Conservatives.




A bigger problem than progressives, everyone knows what they are. You cant have an argument at all if the premise is a lie to begin with. 
example:
progressive: Blacks and white are equal, whites are oppressors
conservatard: blacks and whites are equal, everyone deserves a fair shot
realist: not equal, blacks are dangerous, and will only ruin your neighborhood and subject your sons to crime and your daughter to rape, and drain the tax base

progressive: women in mens bodies need to be in womens sports
conservatard: Women should have their own sports, we should subsidize their college, and Title 9 should be enforced
realist: Title 9 is a fraud, a women sports team should only be allowed if they pay their own way. And lets be honest, sports is most often a waste of time, and all teams that exist should be segregated. womens softball is notorious for lesbian breeding ground

progressive: gay marriage and adoption!
conservatard: I don't care what someone does in their own bedroom, let them get married, who cares, don't approve of adoption
realist: go shoot yourself, they can do their own service in the Unitarian church without the government, and adopters should be arrested, the children are better off in an orphanage

Progressive: We are a nation of immigrants, and borders should not exist. Every migrant can contribute to American society.
Cuckservative: We are indeed a nation of immigrants, but they need to come legally in order to fully integrate into American society.
Realist: Every nation starts off as a nation of immigrants until they decide it's no longer a necessity to have waves of immigrants as we are having today, especially if they aren't White. The country was built by Europeans for Europeans, and the brown hordes coming from the south are incapable of integrating into American society because culture is a manifestation of our genetic make-up and non-Whites can't adapt to our higher standards of living. Those who disagree can happily leave their White suburbs for occupied Detroit or California.

realist: screw them they cheat, they're not as smart as they are made out to be, they tend to be very slavish order followers, and will screw you over any chance they get, and they need to go the eff home.

Men's sports generates revenue. Especially football and basketball. Some colleges like Alabama generate huge revenue from their football team, enough to fund all the rest of the athletic programs. Women's sports is always a loss. They don't get any ratings, nobody cares, and they don't fill stadiums up like the men do. 
Anyone in sports that doesn't generate revenue shouldn't get a scholarship, IMO. Basically all women's sports, and probably most men's sports that's not basketball or football.
These colleges already get too much of our tax money, and I don't see any justification for paying more taxes so little tam tam can get a free ride scholarship in a type of sports that doesn't generate enough revenue to justify giving scholarships.

As a White Nationalist you should attack positions conservatives take that you disagree with. State their reasoning, then state why you object. But attacking the majority of men in this country is not helpful. It’s unproductive, divisive, and adolescent. 
You don’t like their defense of the Jewish People? Great! I don’t either. 
State why they protect them, and why you disagree. A conservative on this forum will be more likely to engage if you use reason and communicate professionally.

If you're talking about the title of the thread, then fine, but conservatism of any type isn't going to get us anywhere. It's too late for that. At best, it can slow things down slightly, which, at this point, isn't going to do a whole lot of good. Conservatives, even paleoconservatives, need to understand that. The thread title could be improved, however.

2. The holding of political views that favor free enterprise, private ownership, and socially traditional ideas.

 Full disclosure, Im not a conservative, although I vote that way because the GOP is the only mainstream party (that I know of) on this planet that defends the unborn. 
WNs discuss abortion almost never, although abortion kills more white babies every year than all the jews and blacks in history.
Conservatives speak out about Abortion alot. They have passed laws protecting the unborn, they protest, they have hotlines for women who feel their only choice is abortion. Conservatives also raise very stable structured homes. Jesus and God are usually the center of such homes, and central to their lives. 
[Im also not a Christian, Im a Disciple of Jesus which is quite different. I say this so its clear Im not defending myself.]
Racialism isn't something they VOICE loudly, but they often do discourage race mixing in their own ways. Christian websites that discuss race mixing often discourage it, not for the same reason we use, but other reasons. 
Also conservatives also very often live in almost all white areas. The problem of course comes when the kids go to a university and are constantly being taught socialism, leftism, atheism, and are being hit on by black people. For fear of being looked at as a racist, they feel they
must talk to them, especially with this BLM crap. (Black leftists are always beggin and demanding things. If I was an Asian, i'd be terribly annoyed).
So neither WNs are perfect, they don't defend the pre-born.
And Conservatives aren't as vocal as I'd like them to be. 
Its true many conservatives don't care about race at all. On FB the other day a woman posted a picture of a black man and white woman with a baby. They were like ""so adorable"". I just put the PUKE emoji. Then a few people went at me. So I said, ""one person in this picture has 12% less brain mass than the other"". And I also said, ""people breed dogs, cats, horses, but they dont breed themselves. Makes no sense"". 
She blocked me as was expected. These people were likely Conservatives almost all of my 'friends' are. 
But back to this thread, calling them retarded is not helpful. What he should have done is made a thread that said something like , ""A few things I disagree with Conservatives on"". A conservative who reads THAT would likely engage instead of being called a Retard.

A husband and wife who adopt non-white children are my enemy. I don't care how ""pro-life"" they are or how often they go to church, or if they've always voted Republican.
Likewise drug-addled serial fornicators who choose not to marry and have children are equally worthless in my eyes. Their claim to be ""pro-White"" is meaningless. (This does not apply to those who are childless for LEGITIMATE reasons.)

Such women are not even White in my eyes. They are pale negroes. However I would not deny the option of abortion to any woman who had good reason. What that reason might be would depend on her particular circumstances.

Legally, there's nothing you can do about abortion. But you can damn sure have white kids, or at the very least not race mix. And to be honest, a female knocked up by an ape should get an abortion.

An unborn White child represents POTENTIAL, unless it's been diagnosed as severely defective in some way. I don't like to destroy potential. On the other hand, an unborn non-white child simply represents another mouth to feed and a drain on society and natural resources. The ""contributions"" made by non-whites are too insignificant to justify cranking out millions of them on the off chance a few might be less than a burden.

Maybe one of the reasons the predicaments we're in are taking so long to conquer is due to white conservatives putting into this society more than they take out and unfortunately pushing back its inevitable expiration date.

They're probably more Joe Average. Big problem is that ""conservatives"" are themselves running behind trends on the racial and gender issues and well, a lot of them are Israel Firsters. You might think I'm only talking about the US - And I'd actually wished that were true. No, I observe similar trends in South Africa. Probably, because 
a) The English media is either liberal or fully leftard. 
b) The Afrikaans media is mostly similar, while they try not to overdo it. Seems there is some more conservative characters that try to be kosher as well. 
c) Your average middle class Afrikaner slightly interested in politics follows American stuff on the internet. 
And most importantly:
d) Afrikaners don't have their own preservatory intellectual institutions. That role was done by the Churches for quite long. But they also jumped on the politically correct band waggon in the 1980s.

Yessir, and thank you. Welcome to Stormfront. Why is it newer members have a better grasp of the situation than some of the ""old guard""? Could it be they haven't been corrupted by the immutable ""movement dogma""? Could it be that they've been around these so-called ""conservatives"" more and know them for what they are?
""Conservatives"" are not only incapable of actually conserving anything, but by the very definition of the term and their inherent nature they cannot be the REVOLUTIONARIES we need. However, as I posted yesterday, we can whisper in their ears, stoke their dissatisfaction with the status quo, gently suggest more and more radical solutions until they finally realize that there really isn't anything left to ""conserve"" in the former USA. That it's time to put down the National Review and pick up Mein Kampf.
The corrupt, farcical ""election"" of 2020 was the eye-opener for them. The equally corrupt and even more absurd and pointless mid-terms of '22 should be the straw that breaks the sheeple's backs. Hopefully.

Re: Conservatives.


There isn't anything wrong with preserving traditional lifestyles. In fact, I think a meaningful, orderly future depends on it. But not everyone is capable of achieving financial success. And I'm really tired of overhearing the ""I've got mine, to hell with everyone else"" right-wing radicals criticizing people they don't even know for being financially poor, as well as condemning social programs that provide monetary relief to those who need such assistance. 
I actually heard it smugly stated by a group of gun range geezers that a blind quadriplegic doesn't need SSD, because they can still lick stamps or something to support themselves without wasting tax dollars.
Capitalism in America has been corrupted beyond the point of ever being beneficial to the average wage-slave, who is forced to shed their blood, sweat, and tears to provide their employers with luxuries while perpetually subsisting at the poverty level.

Not really though. Many, not all, but large percentages (35% to possibly 65%) of ""upper middle-class"" and ""upper-class"" whites are very myopic, selfish, and self-centered. Many of them look down on the lower middle-class and working class masses of their own people and couldn't care less about their lives and struggles.

Is it different with the lower middle class or working class Whites? My experience is that short-sightedness increases when going down the ladder. So do selfishness and envy. The biggest issue with higher-class Whites is that they are under far bigger reputational compliance pressure. While plumber Joe can have an opinion about anything and nobody cares, a doctor, lawyer or merchant will have far more scrutiny on him and he may be ostracised hurting him far more economically, when he expresses politically incorrect opinions publicly. The other thing is that they are more shielded from the negative aspects of ""diversity"" and ""multiculturalism"" than the average family would be. They can afford staying in a security complex (with armed guards) and send their children to private schools that are selective with admission there. So at best they may read about the negative aspects of this in the news. Still with a turn-around they'd fit in as easy with the ""new ideas"" and ""new order"" just as fine as they did with the previous one. 
The real issue are those that can do business (or find employment) globally and those in the heavily leftist academic disciplines mostly in the humanities. They have vested interest in globalitarian and multicultural policy and will support hostile causes even with some conviction. Although I think the corporate side doesn't really care that much about it, they just fall in with the rest not to give more objection than they already do. The academics are a worse issue, since their leftism is some kind of religion to them. 
As for the lower income groups, they are an intelligence services wet dream. They have low self-esteem and can be easily bribed or manipulated otherwise into ""giving information"" with those being a bit more witty functioning as provocateurs. You'll notice them at meetings doing certain things: Creating division over pedantic issues, subverting any potential leadership (all levels and types), pressing for action or being outright flatterers. Not all people doing that are informers/provocateurs of course, but some of them are and they will be more eager to do so. That's why you can't start an organisation from a public meeting outrightly, you need a far more planned and thought through approach. You need to start with a sort of ""board of directors"" that knows how to organise and has got a good judgment on people. Those will of course be of a higher-class background than the average. Not all of them will work, of course. Folks that feel disgruntled or have ego-issues won't work. But they will anyway try to approach the more gullible and build a smaller group of followers they can exploit to polish their ego and perhaps also financially.

There are many places where property is cheap that whites can go to. So white doctors and lawyers that are afraid of losing their position are the same as the bible Pharisees.

It might be changing a bit. I know a liberal turned ""William F. Buckley"" conservative who is now thinking of buying a gun. (He'll probably shoot his foot off. ) I've watched these ""Boomers"" go from ""peace & love"" hippies to ""I got mine"" yuppies to ""muh taxes"" senior-tards. Never was there any concern for ANYONE who can't do something for them, let alone for an abstract concept like race. Now the events of the last year are finally SCARING them awake... somewhat. We'll see how far it goes. If the next negro invasion of a ""white"" suburb involves dragging people out of their homes and killing them, it could be the answer to our prayers. Which is why I don't think their (((handlers))) will ever let it go that far.

The issue is that ""Liberalism"" was infused into main stream thought via it's institutional hegemony. There is not much effort in ""being liberal"" or entertaining an ""everything goes"" attitude. It's essentially ""I don't care"" on steroids. Hence expect anyone to be a bit ""liberal"" at times, regardless of his political affiliation otherwise.

You've got it backwards. Peace and love are abstractions, whereas race is something very concrete. And promoting peace and love is a way of showing concern for others, albeit in a misguided sort of way. Shifting from peace and love to concern for self to concern for one's race is a progression from abstract to concrete, and is a natural progression.
The problem with White people is too much concern with abstractions. Millennials are pro-trans, which is an abstraction, GenZ even more so, GenX less so, and Boomers not so much. Progressing from belief in abstractions to concern with self is the first step toward being concerned for one's race.

Re: Conservatives.


Nothing is more boring than those who complain about middle class, upper-middle class, etc. 
I know many. Regular hard working family types who just like to be left the hell alone. Typical White folks. Of course, have nots always find something they don't like about people, and usually complainers are actually the problem. 
I have been around all spectrums of Whites, from very porr to very wealthy, and see a commonality of unawareness. Few people have the time or desire to find out facts and such beyond just the casual mention. Far too trusting, gullible in various ways.
That's it. The commoners. 
And common Whites favor traditional values, which is what they grew up on, and patriotism, etc. That is the typical 'conservative'. 
Any talk beyond that is just personal fluff of the complainer. 
As we see in (real' voting turn out, there are obviously more conservatives (in various degrees) than any other body. So logically, you'd want to reel in this large body of people. Given the harsh reality of our nation currently, truisms of the enemy are becoming easier to show.

Race is indeed something tangible. But to think about it requires the abstract as well. Peace and Love are weasel-words. Sound nice, but what do you actually mean? It's a way to say ""We represent the good side"" - Those that are for National Defence and limiting their love to their own are of morally lower quality. If you meet such people in reality the whole thing is different, though. It's those that scream slogans the loudest, are usually those that least comply with them.

Although I got to still meet a millennial that unequivocally claims that he is ""pro-trans"". Pro-Gay, I have heard, but not ""pro-trans"". Conditions may however be slightly different here. 
Indeed people should be concerned with oneself first. It's even a Christian message, first to get the beam out of ones own eye. And people need to understand where their interest are - It's with ones own nation or ethnic group. If it's well with them, it's better for oneself. 
But people take it for granted that their interest, at least at a minimal level, will be taken care of. This is after some generations being relatively well off, not knowing hunger or large scale public violence. And lets face it, even poorer White kids were spoilt in their childhood, when you compare that with the parents conditions. Also, there is no corporal punishment any longer, so no real disciplining for house rule compliance. There is some inhibition for violence now, but there is no inhibition to be mean to others, at least that's what I'm noticing. That we get a lot of libtards and Antifa-scum should not surprise at all. Well, BLM is part of this. I'd not overestimate their numbers or approval ratings though. The TV creates this impression by repetitively showing rallies of hundreds of younger people. And indeed the publicity it gets may boost their ranks. Remember that what those otherwise outrageously stupid ideologies have to offer is a sense of purpose in their lives as well as some obnoxious depravation of morality (Fighting against Injustice).

We'll have to disagree on this one. These people are so deracinated that race is absolutely an abstraction to them, and a very distant one. Now in their later years, they are becoming FRIGHTENED over current events; afraid that ""bad people"" (Not non-whites or NEGROES! That would be ""racist"".) will come and take all their ""stuff"" or their worthless lives. It's really just a more extreme expression of ""muh taxes"", which has been their only real concern since moving out of their parents' home.
I know we've locked horns over our generation before. You apparently knew a very different bunch than I did. The ones I knew were middle to upper-middle class and they all became either suburban libtards or conservatards. The few lower class ones I knew are all dead. Poverty and hard living tends to do that.

Devon Stack was talking about how the working class white were the first to turn hard right in the eighties when the reality of mass immigration first became visible. Working class movies of the 70s like CONVOY and White Line Fever were basically all white with with a token, because that was the reality. . Constructiuon and fast food among others were overwhelmed by mexibeans in the eighties. many white collar industries did not have that problem so they got to be hypocrites abouyt it.

Reality finally came to them too. I knew an IT professional who thought he had it made. Then in the late 90s he was told to ""train"" some H-1B visa hindoos. He trained them and then he was fired.
Did that make him change his liberal thinking though?
Nope. Still a libtard to this day.

Only on the surface. There is nobody so obsessed with race as those supposed anti-racists are. That's probably why they have moved away from talking about ""racism"" everywhere, towards talking about ""White Privilege"" and ""White Supremacy"". The paralyzing fear of many Whites to be called ""racists"" does however persist. 
I do however notice that more people get annoyed by this... The annoyance does however still enhance the paralysing effect. The real problem is that conservatives are defensive or even reactionary... The need would be for a clear vision on how the future should look like. And that's where it is lacking. At present it's mostly ""We want the pre-Year 2000 US back"" (or for other countries something in the 1980s - 2000s) - But it's not coming back one needs to design a vision of 2030 that is different from what the globalitarian transhumanists have in mind.

Good luck with that. From what I've seen on this forum over the last ten plus years, it doesn't look very promising. We run the gamut from ""racially exclusive space colonies"" to people wanting to go back to the Stone Age, or at least the beginnings of agriculture... seriously.
My position is that ""globalism"" in its present form is fatal to our race, but retreating to a pre-1492 world is not an option. A properly ordered international HIERARCHY of races/nations would be the ideal, but I don't see the present powers-that-be ever allowing it. So if we never acquire the power ourselves to change it, we'll have to find some way of preserving our race within the current context, IF POSSIBLE.

If you meet such people in reality the whole thing is different, though. It's those that scream slogans the loudest, are usually those that least comply with them.

The point I'm trying to make is that, when a person practices an unhealthy form of altruism, he first must pass through a state of being selfish in order to progress to a healthy form of altruism.
For the generations before mine, it was civic responsibility. For my generation, let's say it was peace and love. For later generations, it might be gay rights or whatever. Before they can practice a healthy form of altruism, such as love of one's race, they must first pass through a time of being selfish. No one goes directly from unhelathy altruism directly to healthy altruism; there is a process involved. In the cases of civic responsibility or peace and love, those could be good in the right context, but they were not always practiced in the right context. Gay or trans rights are not good in any context.

I don't think many of you have a good handle on Conservatives. Perhaps you watch too much tv or (unfortunately) believe in polls and other such nonsense. 
ALL political groups have their factions. Having a large amount of people I know in all walks of life and Conservative, ideas and motivations and thoughts of things are not subject to status or wealth. 
Same with liberals. I know some of them too. I see a lot of rubes misguided, yet then do not follow all things.
There are factions and their commonalities. You can't paint with a broad brush. If you do, like I have said, enjoy your cult. You will never grow your numbers.

Since you posted a graphic with this, I'm assuming it's part of some academic social psychology theory. Must be something relatively new, because I never heard of it when I was working on my degree a couple generations ago. I remain unconvinced. It seems counterintuitive, and that is a bad starting point. I would have to see a substantial number of GOOD studies to be persuaded.
To me it seems that liberals have lost a proper sense of ""us vs them"". They think ""we are all the same"" and their ""tribe"" is everyone on this planet. We know why and how this happened. What they need is to be shown that these ""others"" that they value do not value THEM or have their best interests in mind. Nor do they think of them as ""one of them"", regardless of what the liberal might think. 
As for ""self-interest"", I believe liberals are already there in their purported ""altruism"". They adopt this mindset because it makes them FEEL GOOD AND RIGHTEOUS, and they are validated by other liberals. We simply need for them to limit that to their OWN PEOPLE. Truly ""selfish"" individuals don't give a rat's ass about anyone, unless they can get something from them. They seldom change or progress to any other stage, or so my personal experience has shown.

I'm not fond of labels myself, but sometimes they are necessary in order to have a sensible discussion. The reality is there are millions of ""white"" people out there who do not share our views for one reason or another. When discussing and analyzing these reasons we have to catagorize them in some way. Labels help to facilitate that. If some use them pejoratively, that is understandable given our minority status and our feelings of oppression. It's not easy to keep smiling when people are trying to kill you.

No, it's my own personal obsesrvation based on how I went from unhealthy altruism to healthy altruism.

Exactly, and in order for them to do that, they have to pass through a phase of selfishness, where the see that the others do not value them, and that therefore they should not value the others.

The nonsense is claiming that large percentages of Conservatives haven't been selling out their Race for many many decades and that large percentages of them aren't completely deracinated. There are many of them across the country and in every single state that are even gung-ho ""diversity is our strength"", ""we're all one race, the human race"", and ""love see's no color"" anti-racist and even race-mixing traitors. That some aren't like that doesn't mean that many aren't just like that and have been proving it in the real world for a very long time.
I think many have a better handle on Conservatives than you do (I don't think you're honest in many of your comments on this topic) and it's from real life experiences and from paying attention to what Conservatives, in very large percentages, have done and voted for over the last 40, 50, even 60 years. Far too many are just as brainwashed by ""Conservative Inc."" (lackey faction of tptb and some higher level insiders as well) and all their hundreds of millions of dollars in propaganda and conditioning as are liberals, leftists, progressives, and democrats. 
Many even read books to gain insights, understanding, knowledge, and perspective...
Revilo P. Oliver, William Pierce, George Lincoln Rockwell, Wilmot Robertson, Willis Carto, Francis Parker Yockey, Leon Degrelle, and many other luminaries have discussed and highlighted the problem well over just the last 60 years. Going back further there has been others and I don't think it should be necessary to even name one of the most well known.

There is no gain with such activity. And we can see the results of those with no gain and much longevity. No movement.

That's why there isn't that much resistance, since Conservatives have no other stronger source of world view that could challenge present day neo-leftist cultural hegemony. So it doesn't even help you, if one is in the majority, when the enemy controls the loci of interpretation, which are media, communication and educational institutions.

What does this matter? You have a large body of people with no options. 
So people here insult them? 
There are only two options in our political spectrum here. A third will never take off. Not anywhere in the remote future.
So obviously, you use what you have. You find a way to bring ideas and movement into what you have and bring the people.
To do this you need a vehicle. You need representation.
This is all 101....

Conservatives are simply folks of traditional values and patriotism. -Even though they don’t know much about either.
So you need a VIABLE source or group to pull them the hell out of the bs pit they are in to.
You cannot do this on a small level. You cannot do this with extreme ideas. You need a solid large stage platform thst is appealing enough to TRANSITION to. Enough similarities to want to go to.
If we look at most Whites, there are commonalities. You start there.

Large percentages of them deserve to be insulted, and deserve to be shamed for their actions and attitudes on many critical and important topics. This has been a problem for over 40, 50, even 60 years.
Those who're worthy and who're looking for truth and a better way should be able to handle some criticism and even insults for certain ways of thinking and mindsets. Especially if they're here reading one of the most ""notorious"" and ""racist"" websites of the last 25 years.

Nonsense. Large numbers and large percentages are looking for better ways and looking for different options to what they know is very wrong within both of the ""two options"".
The ""two options"" are complete dead ends and the 'lesser evil' or better of the two options is still extremely inadequate, extremely flawed, and consists of far too many falsehoods and weaknesses.
Racial-Nationalists and White Nationalists are, overall and in the majority, neither left nor right, neither liberal nor conservative. We are a Third Position.

What are you waiting for? Why can't you do it since you claim to be such a magnificent representative of Whites and that you personally know and know of so many in general who're like-minded? Considering all your claims and assertions it should be easy for someone like you. You and all these types you say exist should be able to create a large mass movement in no time.
Many if not most here (those who have any kind of broad and deep understanding and perspective on our predicament) don't agree with you on most of your assertions and claims. There are people out there who do though. Nick Fuentes of America First. Steven Crowder. Mark Dice. Have at it, they all have large audiences. There's at least a half dozen more who could be named. Maybe you're on the wrong site and talking to the wrong people. 
If these guys mentioned and similar can't make headway with the money and resources they have then what makes you think you're going to be able to create anything different than what they've got?

The problem is the general one of democracy and that is that it splashes the more cunning, smooth-talking opportunistic, low risk-taking individuals to the top. When they are in positions of leadership they will talk with a forked tongue, trying to please and influence their voting block, while also pleasing their sponsors. That has also shifted the views of otherwise conservative folks towards the mean, which was shifting leftwards for the last 60 years at least, if it isn't 100, already. 
Such individuals should be mocked and insulted and by them I don't mean those that are perhaps only more pragmatic. The problem is that one can not win the mass of people over with rational arguments (alone). That simply doesn't work for 95% of people. They should indeed be shamed and ridiculed for falling for ""diversity"" and Israel-firsting, and for believing that those are ""National Values"", but one should be careful not to alienate them too much neither. Before engaging in it, one needs to have ones own means, motive, vision and strategy right.

I don't disagree with this and especially what's in bold.
The problem is that too many here more recently (4, 5, 6 years or so) think that you can't even harshly criticize conservatives at all without alienating them. Or at least that's what you'd think from their posts, their complaining, and their overly sensitive defenses of the indefensible.
It is a fine line and tenuous balance though. Many to most are hardly worth the effort and will most likely NEVER be able to make the leap to a right way of thinking and acting such that it corrects all that needs to be corrected and changed..

Strawman, besides the point, and irrelevant. No one said that. NO ONE.
The problem is that large percentages, and very large numbers (tens of millions), are a serious problem and have been a serious problem for many many decades.
That problem is that those types are race-mixers (or have mixed race grandchildren and/or family members that color/distort their views), are EXTREMELY deracinated, against ""identity politics (that's us), and against any kind of explicitly pro-White Racial advocacy and identity. Among other problems with their types and of which there are tens of millions of them.

Them Cohnservatives are quite sensitive to critique, take any critique serious, especially when it comes from authority figures. So they either avoid it or try to comply with the critics, which is what got us them cucks. 
Personally however that one needs to start from RIGHT, and only then go for the wrongs. 
One needs to shape and define ideal conservative values and contrast them with false values. The opposite has been done over the years. Create a negative strawman conservative and later replace it with another strawman in terms of the new values of ""diversity, tolerance and inclusiveness"".

That's a completely ambigious and nonsensical claim and assertion. They aren't a majority and they don't all fit in one category. 
Then there's the fact that tens of millions of Conservatives over just the last 20 to 30 years self-identify as being ""opposed to racism"", self identify as being ""color blind"", and are ""opposed to identity politics of any kind"". Many millions are race-mixers and don't care about Race at all and consistently say that they don't think it matters and that it's ONLY the ideas, values, and culture that matter (it's irrelevant that they don't realize Race is what creates those things, they'll argue til their blue in the face that you're wrong if you say that they do). 
You consistently paint a FALSE picture of what the majority of Conservative believe and think.

More empty 'casting aspersions' and inversions of reality. Just your views on ""true Christianity"" and who the ""real jews are"" alone (and that White-Europeans are supposedly the ""real hebrews"" of the bible), put you COMPLETELY at odds with 90% or more of the mainstream masses of Christians, Conservatives and Republicans (this supposed ""majority"" you constantly speak of). That means that all of those you constantly defend and shill for here would look at you the same, and call you a kook, a cultist, and insane. Those same percentages would also call you ""evil"" and insane for your views on HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS (over a BILLION in reality) of black/african and other non-White devout and devoted Christians.

Ideal conservative values - like what? Pro-White traditional values?

Yes, perhaps not in that wording, but something conducive to this. The question is how to instil them. In the past this was done via the churches, education, literature and what other issues that could count as cultural industry. The churches taught things more in line with natural order. Folk, Family, Fatherland. In education the emphasis are on the achievements and character of ones own nation -> Especially via history. Performance, achievement, experience, adventure and other positive virtues of groups or personality were appreciated and this was also part of the literature that dealt with soldiers, leaders, artists, inventors, poets, explorers etc. Notice that those things were phased out and replaced with ""critical race theory"" (Essentially nagging on/about values, institutions, personalities, etc. ). And what's presented as heroes is actors, mediocre singers and of course those that are ""discriminated and downtrodden"" - perpetual victims. White Nations are placed on the accusation bench, so are personalities, organisations and institutions etc. That gaslighting (which is tax payer funded and also supported by the movie industry) needs to be stopped, those engaging in it, be purged from society.

ONCE AGAIN, Conservatives are the MAJORITY of vastly different types all fit into ONE category that is allowed them.
Now try to let that sink in first before you move to the next sentence, I know it is hard for you...
That large body of people, most smarter than you, is the target audience we would want to tap. 
If you dont like that or understand how that would work, you simply stay in your clique of disgruntled fools.

Not only did he ""try something"", he SUCCEEDED because he had the support of tens of millions of racially aware and ethnically proud Germans who ""knew the jew"" going back centuries. There were no negroes, no mestizos, no hindus, no Asians in any number to oppose his programs. No ""Zio-Christians"" and few of the liberal leaning churchmen dared speak out. Commies and other degenerate elements had been defeated on the streets and slunk back into the shadows. Most importantly, though the jews had entrenched themselves in many areas of German society, notably education and the media, they never gained the sort of governmental power they hold today in the West, especially in the UK and the USA. When the NSDAP was elected, it was ""all she wrote"" for Hymie & co.
Now, what similarities are there with our current situation? Take your time coming up with an answer; a day, a week, a month, a year, a decade, forever...

As many will be rubbing their hands to come in to say, ""there are some similarities"", HOWEVER, the full picture shows that there are FAR MORE and FAR greater dissimilarities.
The dissimilarities outweigh the similarities by a massive amount. As, in part, you've already pointed out. There are other elements that could easily be highlighted to further show that there really isn't much of a comparison when looked at on the whole..

You people who spend time with nonsense only drive people away, not make them think and what to join.


They are our target population segment to bring towards white nationalism. Once they have become racially aware conservativism has to stop. 
I post on a kosher conservative forum (and boy is it kosher!) because it is ""where the ducks are"" , if you will excuse a phrase from the Jew Barry Goldwater.
But I no longer identify as a conservative. I am a white nationalist.

ALL intellectually honest and objective critical thinkers of non-jewish White-European descent are the target population. That includes many others than just those who identify with conservatism. Many self-described conservatives and many self-described zionist judeo-christian types are woefully dogmatic and entrenched with ""religious zeal"" in their ""anti-racist"" kosher-righteousness and will likely and unfortunately remain that way until their dying breath. That's a fact despite those who continue to falsely assert otherwise.
There's been and there continues to be MANY who come from the left and from liberalism (even out right antifa and commies have been known to come over) to being ""race realist"" jew-wise Racial-Nationalists and Ethno-Nationalists. Too many fail to acknowledge and understand those realities. Many old Sf members from the past and long time members here have been known to have done so.

Re: Conservatives.


There are large numbers of younger conservatives. Nick Fuentes and his America First has large numbers. He's getting over $50,000 a year recently in donations and funding. Mark Dice, Steven Crowder, Joe Rogan, and a couple others all have large followings and are raking in millions. They all are potential stepping stones for their audiences to better and real jew-wise pro-White Racialist perspectives, understandings, outlooks, and possible action in the right directions. Of course, at the same time, they all are problematic and represent potential pitfalls and gatekeeping.
No one knows for sure what it all means in the larger picture and in the long run. It's hard to judge definitively all of that. Only time will tell the full story.
Being overly simplistic and one-dimensional in either direction when assessing these things and talking about them isn't helpful to us and does us no favors.

Exactly.
Those who have been on this planet longer know a bit more than those who have just arrived here. 
Lack of respect to elders shows weakness of character.

I just don`t get this ""boomer"" ""gen X"" etc ad infinitum thing at all; as if age is the important factor in forming one`s opinions! This generation gap thing is just another (((ploy))) to stir divisions within White societies.
You`re either a Pro-White or an Anti-White....this is my take for what it`s worth.

I concur. 
Too bad everyone isn't so easily distracted by such divisive diversions, which is what all of the various forms of BS occurring these days actually is.

Age alone doesn't mean diddly squat nowadays and especially in regards to our pro-White Racialist predicament and Cause. There are plenty and many examples of younger folk who are more informed and more knowledgable about many specifics than many older folk.
""Those who just arrived here"" is a lame exaggeration. There aren't any babies or even teenagers who're part of this discussion. It's more a matter of those in their 20's and 30's complaining and mocking those in their 50's, 60's, and older. There's some truth to much of what they complain about, and plenty that's legitimately mockable among the general population and even large percentages of conservatives, and you're not that far off from being a perfect example.
