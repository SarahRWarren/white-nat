The way forward: Positive White Nationalism




*Mods to please sticky this if possible*The way forward: Positive White Nationalism
The goal of this post is to create a cohesive strategy for awakening our people and eventually generating a modern European cultural renaissance. It is less of a nuts-and-bolts solution, and is more of an over-arching philosophy and lifestyle, an ethos for white nationalists to follow which will allow solutions to occur and to move us forward towards the results that we want. 
These ideas aren't necessarily things that I invented. I am attempting to synthesize, for your benefit, many ideas from national philosophy, psychology, marketing, and elsewhere into a set of ideals that I know will work if we can hold ourselves to them. I'm calling it ""Positive White Nationalism"" for lack of a better term at the moment. So what is PWN and what are the core ideas that make it work? Lets explore...:-Concentrate on Solutions, Not Problems 
It has been proven that people will subconsciously move toward what they concentrate on. If that happens to be what they don't want, then they will move in that direction whether they like it or not. I remember back when I was a teen, my driving instructor told us ""not to look at big trucks beside you on the highway; you'll steer right into them."" It's a nice metaphor for many things in life. Whatever you feed in your life with your attention, that is what your mind will go to work on. If we can steer ourselves towards the solutions, and not the problems, then that will at least get us pointed in the right direction. 
Speaking to many of you, I can tell that you are depressed. It seems that so many in our society are... and no wonder: so much of our society is grim. Hearing something bad or hearing about a problem creates a sensation of anger. Anger, when not acted upon, leads to feelings of frustration. This can be especially acute in men. Frustration, when built up enough, leads to feelings of futility, helplessness, and powerlessness, which is essentially ""depression"". To prevent this, you can either channel your feelings of anger into activity, or you can dial back the input of negative information. I'm proposing that people do both. By concentrating on the solutions, you focus your attention away from negative input, while at the same time encouraging you to act in a way that alleviates your anger in a constructive manner.-Reframe the Negative and Find the Positive 
On the surface this feels like such a juvenile thing. There is so much negative. We are truly facing the extinction of what most of us hold most dear. It feels overwhelming. Crushing. To ""pretend"" to be positive sounds ridiculous. I'm not talking about pretending. It may feel that way slightly at first. I'm talking about truly making the effort to find the positive in situations. It's always there. I can promise you that. Let me give you an example: say you read an article about a film and it's very anti-white. Instead of concentrating on that and talking about it, look for a film that isn't anti-white or even has pro-white messages. They do exist. The Invasion (2007) was packed full of underlying messages that support our views (which is why critics hated it!). 
I'm not condoning ignorance here, I'm saying that we can't get anywhere if we focus on the negative. Negative thoughts can be highly addictive. They will also destroy you and poison your life. Acknowledge the problems, but don't feed them. Push forward. 
The other benefit to this is that it makes our movement (and you as an individual) 1000 times more attractive to outsiders. You simply cannot attract people with a negative movement. Even in Germany, it wasn't the anti-Semitic rhetoric that got the German people on board, it was the hope, the positive message of unification and prosperity in the face of a destitute and broken future for the working class. We know that things are bad. Lets aim toward a future that works instead of wasting our energies on a past that we cannot change. I realize that at times it can be hard to enjoy your life because it seems like ""what's the point if it's all going out the window"". We all need to find ways to enjoy our lives though, and pull our thinking out of the venomous death spiral.-Lift your Own Race Up, Don't Push Others Down
If we want to spin our wheels trying to disparage other races while our own gets wiped off the map, then I say we deserve to die. It is futile and idiotic. We need to be helping out our own people, not doing petty sniping at others. Don't waste your energies on them. Let them do their own thing. They don't concern us. We concern us. Try doing real-world activities to help your white community. Be prepared to fight, but put your efforts into things that actually help in the present. Add value to your community, instead of take from it. Make money so you can support causes. Be an example of what is good so others can follow it. Find locals that are in need and organize a function to tackle that need. Celebrate what is good and amazing about our own culture instead of trying to point out what is bad about other cultures. That is attractive to people. That makes people want to experience and value the things that we value about our race. The only way we're going to create enough unity among our people to overcome the massive challenges ahead of us is to make them care about who they are. The only way we're going to do that is by showing and demonstrating all of the good qualities of our race. Bringing down someone else might make you feel good temporarily, but it makes you look bad and it undermines your message. Be the best that you can be in your life. You represent us!-Actions, Not Words
Whenever you can, force yourself to take an action, rather than make a rant or post something. It might sound weird, but say, upon hearing something that especially makes you sad and angry about race... maybe about a child getting hurt: instead of just wallowing in that, force yourself to do something. I don't mean seek out the guy that hurt the child and gun him down, I mean something constructive. 
Maybe your neighbor has a child that likes motorcycles. Invite your neighbor and his kid over and let the child help you fix yours while his dad and you drink a beer. I don't know. Something. Anything. Any positive action towards another white person is better than thoughts or futile posts against another non-white. 
Do it right away though. Don't give your anger time to settle inside you. Let it force you to act. We are designed to act! We are biological machines of action. Spend some time in the PLE posts and see that action speaks louder than words. You will feel so much better, your race will thank you, and the world will look upon us in a better light.
I realize that alot of this feels a little alien and perhaps cheesy. I myself, am a fighter by instinct, and alot of this goes against what I am ingrained to think, but in a sense, this IS fighting. It's fighting against the void that is threatening to swallow us up. 
Roll up your sleeves and take the 3 week PWN challenge: What is the 3 week PWN challenge you ask?... 
I challenge all stormfronters, including myself, to not post a single negative post for 3 weeks. Challenge yourself to find the positive. Challenge yourself to find a solution. Ask yourself, are you content to stew in a present where we are a doomed people, or are you willing to make the effort to at least try to move us in a different direction? You have nothing to lose. In the words of Jerry Maguire: ""Who's coming with me?""

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Although I am a new member and my recommendation doesn't carry much weight, I agree entirely that this should be a sticky. We need much more positive attitude tossed around this forum. It's good for everyone. 
I applaud everything you said. I've personally been fighting with myself because of the constant bombardment of negativity in my surrounding environment, but you helped me get back into this positive mindset just by writing that. 
I realized a few years ago that those who are most successful AND happy have restructured their mindset to recognize the positive in everything. It definitely takes time to restructure your mindset because we've had years of indoctrination that structured our minds the way they are, but we can all do it. We can plant the positive seeds by simply picking up a few motivational books or talking to some positive people (like the fellow above). If we continuously water those seeds with practice and further reading/conversation then they'll blossom into something great. This has been proven countless times. If others can do it then so can you and I. 
Simply adding on to what he said above: every time we read a negative news article we can write a positive news article of our own. We can all create a blog within a few clicks these days. Likewise, whenever we see an anti-white movie come out we can post a positive pro-white video on YouTube. If enough of us work together on this then we can saturate the internet with positive pro-white material and draw many more into our movement. 
Our forefathers laid a great foundation for us and we're all proud of them for their accomplishments. We should challenge ourselves to lay an equally or greater foundation for our children/grandchildren. We have the seeds of greatness in every single one of us. All we have to do is look at our ancestors - the very DNA we came from - and look at their accomplishments. We inherited that DNA so we're most certainly capable of achieving their greatness. It all starts with what he wrote about above - our positive mindset. Whoever nails that down is an unstoppable force who will achieve great things in their life.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


PoliticalNationalist,
Thank you for your well-spoken kind words. You hit several nails on the head there. Our ancestors didn't go forth and multiply by sitting in their cottages getting angry, reading Infowars.com and despairing. They rolled up their sleeves and did what they could with the time they had. They plowed their fields, they loved their families, they danced and drank with their fellow men and women. When it was time to fight, they got together and did something about it. Negative thought should lead to positive action, or it should be turned to positive thought. We have enough problems without torturing ourselves with an endless list of things we can do nothing about. 
People don't want to join a dying cause, they want to join a living one.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


You make a very good point Unlearn. Negativity has never been a facet of any successful movement or political party. There is some cartharsis in posting scathing remarks toward Zionists in News links and Articles but considering that is the most visited section; perhaps there is too much. 
I am of the opinion that the average white man will start to think like us in the next few decades as he watches Mexicans invade the U.S. and the Muslims invade Europe. I think the future is brighter than what it seems now. It can only get so bad before the white man watches his children go hungry and decides to act. Once one nation throws off the chains of diversity others will follow. Well that's my positive post.

Just saying the Word White makes Anti-White White uncomfortable and defensive. 
They will call you a racist on the spot for acknowledging your own White skin.
I told my father I'm White and proud.
He called me a racist.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


I love the idea of Positive WN vis a vis the archaic blaming of others that has led to mostly stagnation. The same methodology applies in your daily life. If you are positive and upbeat, then that attracts people and makes them want to be in your company. If you're a negative, pessimist who finds fault in everyone and everything, then you'll find people pulling away from you.

There is nothing soft about what I am espousing here. If we have white unity, we win. We get white unity by moving toward what is positive about our race. Your fighting instinct is admirable, now channel it into a victorious future. Organize, build, move forward.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism




Our political arm is positive when it has to be. We encourage people to fight the enemy who wants to destroy our existence and upend our lives. Our paramilitary is there to intimidate our enemy, protect and defend our members and other whites as well as observe the enemy to plan and gain the upperhand. Much like Sun Tzu's Art Of War.The Aryan Volunteer Guard will at first be modeled after the Guardian Angels. We also are positive in that like Golden Dawn we will have a Social Solidarity Program to help get food, medicine and clothing to whites in need and offer whites and white business owners protection in exchange for donations and support at the polls.

Sounds like some good, community action. Keep it up!

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


When you take a look at some of the successful movements overseas, like the Golden Dawn in Greece, they're doing food drives and stuff for the poor, and actually going out and helping people in other ways as well. And making a presence in public while doing it. I don't see people in the WN movement in the USA doing that in any kind of organized effort.
As far as negativity goes, it might work if WNs owned the media instead of Jews, but we don't have the clout to reach that broad of an audience without an incredibly hostile Jew media spreading lies and working contrary to any message we could put out to the masses.

Were trying to change that. You need a group with 3 functions:

Paramilitary- Protection and defense of white citizens.
Social Solidarity- Like Golden Dawn. Food, Medicine. Blood drives. Protection

Agreed
I would personally add a 4th group who are dedicated to restoring positive European culture in film, art, music, etc. since I believe above all that our enemies have used those outlets to a ridiculously successful degree to brainwash and corrupt the minds of today.
I would definitely be willing to help out with this in any way I can. I'm unemployed at the moment but I believe organized spreading of our ideas and aims on the web is most effective in this day and age.

This is the ONLY way to accomplish our goals! Look at every other political party to take power, esp the nazi's and the communists. They boosted themselves first, above all, then, and only then did they worry about trash talking the opposition. 
If we keep bashing the blacks and jews , everyone that might join wont for fear of the socail stigma, and we sound like bitter people. 
White kids act black because the media is constantly telling them how cool it is and how good it feels to be black. We need to do the exact same thing and make it cool to be white. Once its established that being white is a great thing, then we start showing the faults of the enemies. just my 2cents.

I'm sorry Nate, but that type of mentality, very common in our movement simply doesn't work. It has never worked, and it never will work. Period.
You speak of fighting a war, so did Unlearn. You want to take to the streets? Fight it out in a blaze of glory and gunpowder? Yes, we should all be prepared to fight, but that should not be the only, or the first option. I would say it bothters me, but really it saddens me, because that mindset is a mindset of preemptive defeat.
Battles today, the important ones, are not won with steel and lead. They are won in ballot boxes, bank accounts, and most importantly in the hearts of the people we are trying to reach and help, which is OUR white race.
Unlearn, you have made a wonderful post, this is exactly the mindset we need more of. This is the mindset of a victor, one who wins not by vanquishing a foe, the large majority of who have done nothing wrong, but one who wins by helping a friend, uplifting his people, not seeking to harm others.

Indeed, I read a post of yours on another thread that I thought was really good, I understand I can come across like a pompous dickhead at times, so forgive me for that. You had made a post about social solidarity and sticking together as white people and I thought it was great.
I guess to me, I would like to see all violent rhetoric removed, but that wouldn't be fair. I see , in my mind, a victory for white people, but I pray that it never requires taking up arms. I see us helping each other out, educating those who do not know, and strategically taking control of business, government and media.
I will say, that I will at least try to open my mind more.

NOTHING can be won at the ballot box anymore in the US. Move on. Bank accounts? They can be wiped out with the click of a mouse at the discretion of the ""authorities.""
Land. Occupied territory. That is REAL power. Give our people something they have a tangible as well as emotional connection to. Something that will support them when all else fails. Something to defend.

GD is successful because the Greek people KNOW WHO THEY ARE, and are fiercely proud of it. They have a deep sense of ethnic identity that has been lost in most of the rest of the western world.

But the OP is correct. A positive, proactive approach is best. We need to stop worrying so much about what our opponents think and do, and start concentrating on what's in OUR BEST INTEREST.
Let them worry about us for a change.

Unlearn, you have made a wonderful post, this is exactly the mindset we need more of. This is the mindset of a victor, one who wins not by vanquishing a foe, the large majority of who have done nothing wrong, but one who wins by helping a friend, uplifting his people, not seeking to harm others.


Hats off to ya.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism




A powerful theme to emerge from this thread is the need for Whites to feel a sense of social solidarity. This is exactly what is lacking for us in our present societies; we no longer belong and are at the mercy of those who are calling the shots.
One of the reasons I am here (Apart from believing strongly in White Nationalism) is to find fellow travellers; I want to find the community to which I and my family belong. The social solidarity spoken about here is what has the potential to bring people along; bring them out into the open to stand with their brothers and sisters.
Excellent discussion!

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Social Solidarity isn't just a part of our community but also a way to reach into the lives, hearts and minds of people we want to bring into our circle. People who are also tired of multiculturalism, crime and the loss of values who may be on the fringe of wanting to join our movement but don't know how or are afraid because of the negativity associated with the propaganda against us.Using Golden Dawn as a model is essential for us. They have proven to be able to recruit people, funding and support at the ballot box by serving the people in their community by supporting food drives, blood drives, protecting people and forcing open toll roads etc.We need to utilize this very effective strategy.. hence Aryan Storm!

Golden Dawn is still a reactionary party. They are mired in the blaming of others and are responsible for a great deal of thuggery, even if it is well intended. Being reactionary is always a weak position. Let others react to us. Let us move ahead with the success of our own people. I hope your project can take what it can from the Golden Dawn pagebook and evolve a better solution than they have.
Be careful: when people receive help but then are given speeches and propaganda, they tend to feel.... tricked. It leaves a bitter taste in their mouths. Like having a religious organization help you and then they want you to contibute to their church, etc. If you organize and do good in your community, which it sounds like you're trying to do, make sure you're truly doing it to help and not to try and get something from people. I'm not saying any of this to criticize, I just want all of us to be aware how people see actions. I do believe most WN's have pure intentions. They genuinely DO want to help their own survive, despite media portayal of us all being rabid animals. If I didn't believe that I wouldn't be here. I have faith that if we can come together and just tow the line straight ahead without getting distracted in these petty little wars and battles, we'll come out doing well.

I appreciate and learn from positive feedback. It's when idiots like the guy who suggested the Klingon logo and flag from star trek puts his idiocy in when I get leery. 
A lot has to happen for this to take off but so far we are averaging over 500 new visitors a day and 11 applications. I have people wanting me to start chapters in 14 states and 5 countries but Im telling them they need to start the chapter. We will give them guidance and assistance. 
Social Solidarity is important. We wont give them a speech after helping them, instead we will often be very subtle but in turn I expect us to receive positive support both tacit, and open.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


All of us who consider ourselves racially conscious individuals and who really want to see our Race & Family preserved must work to be ourselves with boldness, and establish connections beyond simple internet names and emails. We have to keep up the networking, but we have to take it to the next level. To do this, I suggest we search out and hunt our area, our town, our county, or state, our country for like minded people like us who we can befriend, help, and strengthen at a moment's notice. We need to get out there and meet others like ourselves and make connections that last a lifetime. We need to boldly and unreservedly share the ideology as if we were talking about the most common thing we have ever known. And this means we have to know the ideology back and front. We have to network, connect, befriend, meet and unite to make communities wherever a good amount of us may be gathered. These communities can then work to remain separate and exclusively White so that our children can be raised up in a safe environment with good schooling and White surroundings so as to encourage a deep appreciation for our heritage and culture.

Internationalism is important but as each country stands up it's own party and organization we can hand off to them and stay aligned but focus where there aren't strong movements.
We need to organize in North America primarily but Europe, Australia and some parts of Africa and South America need help.
The more broad based we are the better.

Interesting posts. I have read some positive posts as well as negative posts that are inflammatory to the readership that can be dividing. Then there are posts with very little said, intellectually that is, except for little cartoons, images, graphics etc. that really makes fun of and/or adds very little to the movement. Perhaps those are people who think they are funny and adding a little bit of lightheartedness, but most of it fails as most likely we all just bypass such laziness to actually add something to the thread.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


You must remember that communism, national socialism and fascism only came to power because of extreme economic crisis. Without these kinds of shocks the publics in any country wouldn't have accepted any of these forms of tyrannical governance. I'm an apologist for national socialism, and it may have been necessary in Germany at the time, but the authoritarian nature of it runs against my libertarian principles as an ideal form of government.
I am fervently for an ascendant WN political movement which will counter race-mixing liberalism and guarantee the supremacy of European civilization. This should be done in a tolerant, open and free society. Race-mixing imposed by the state is against freedom of association and is a form of tyranny of a majority.
With that said do I agree with your formula?
Yes and No.
No....
Sorry but you have to go negative. No movement will gain support and no election is ever won my not going negative. You have to scare the public by telling them the facts. You have to inform them of the truth that all we have is our civilization and that's being destroyed by the crimes committed by inferior races and those who lie about them. You have to do what George Bush did in 1988 and put up the face of negro Willie Horton and remind people that faces like that rape, steal, lie, murder, and will take any nice neighborhood they move into and make it a hell.
You have to scare them with the truth or they won't donate time and money much less vote for you.
Yes....
In the public mind rejection of race-mixing is conflated with.....HATE.
No good person wants to hate. No society is going to be built on hate.
The WN movement won't go anywhere until and unless it can DISSCONNECT THE PUBLIC'S VIEW THAT RACISM IS HATE.
It's of course the negros and other malignant groups that push this view....
But it must be countervailed.
Conclusion....
A white separatist movement can gain a majority support of the white public if it is based on....
1.a recognition that negros are for whatever reason incapable of integration into civilized white society.
2.that the social experiment of integration has failed
3.that we must re-institute freedom of association in public and commercial as well as private life.
4.that rejection of negro culture isn't malice towards them but merely isolation of white culture from their destructive effects.
The battleground is communications. Documentaries, films, radio, books and articles are the means for pointing out the facts which prove that negros are incapable of civilization.
Once the white public has rejected the myth of negro moral equality than the laws requiring race mixing can be rescended.
Once race-mixing is no longer required by the state then whites will simply out-compete and out-perform negros such that they will become culturally isolated and discredited.

It's a good idea to be positive, but i wont help us survive, we have to go political! make a new political party and spread this messages, we dont need to kill or deport other races, we just have to control them, the new WN message should be PROTECT ALL RACES stop mixing, spread a massege of love, while white people controls the government and breeds faster than other races.
If we regain control of our countries we won't be erased, once we are many again, then we will have to think what to do with the other races living among us, but now, surviving is the most important thing to do.
We have to start all over again, we have to work to create the new roots for the future of our race, because at this point everything our ancestors did has been destroyed.

The reason why Whites are superior is because of Whites' empathy and compassion for others. It's this spiritual element of kindness and gentleness which underlies everything. Christianity is based on love, as opposed to Judaism which is based on oppression and fear.
The reason why negros, Mexicans, and other inferior races are inferior is because of their PRIMITIVE brutality, their savagry, their selfishness and callous indifference to others.
When the WN movement realizes this and puts aside it's ""bully-boy"" elements it will become the majority among all whites.

Couldn't agree more, Africa is the living proof, they control almost half the resources of earth, they are even more in number than we have ever been, they receive billions of dolars from foreign countries, and they still Poor because the only thing they can think of, is stealing, raping and killing eachother.

Absolutely correct. Unless eastern European nations quickly embrace nationalism and then embark on a reconquest of western Europe and abroad, our only way forward is ELITE SEPARATISM. The vast majority of ""whites"" in the West are beyond recovery. They are quite comfortable with the new order of things. Let them be. We racially conscious WHITES have our own destiny.

 Apparently paternal colonialism is still alive and well in South America!
NO, NO, NO! White Nationalism is NOT about taking up the ""White Man's Burden"" again! We are about total and complete SEPARATION! It was meddlesome misplaced Christian altruism which got us into this mess in the first place. The greatest heresy the Church ever committed was attempting to convert the savages in Africa and the New World. They should have been left to their own religions and ways.
But this discussion is irrelevant. We will never have the power to make such decisions about other races again, at least in any forseeable future. Right now we need to concern ourselves with our OWN survival. To do this we need to identify all those of our people who share our concerns and have the desire and ability to help us move forward.
Everyone else simply needs to stay out of our way.

We need not control or manipulate anyone. That's how we got into this mess. Our message is a good one on its own and all we need to do is put it out there without any hidden agendas.
I do agree that we need to be political, and spreading a positive message is the way to grow your political base. It doesn't have to be based on fear or deception.

You've right when it comes to western Europe. Sadly some of the eastern European countrys still are a bit behind.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


The easiest way to get fiercely loyal members and recruits? Simple, do not let his children go to bed hungry. Become ""Uncle or Aunt"" so and so that shows up with food, school supplies, seasonally appropriate clothing, etc. I've won dozens of converts from the lower income segment of our population, just by giving away fish and game during lean times for hungry families, or by showing up with a truck load of fresh garden surplus. It is cheap, it is easy, it is effective.
Work/shop somewhere that has ""coupon free stuff"" for cardholders, and/or steep employee discounts? Even if YOU do not need the give away item, there is a white person or family that does. Get the item, find a recipient. 
Have a garden? Plant one row extra of everything, and freely give the produce from those extra rows away. Give it, no strings attached, no preaching, no price tags. Have meat chickens? Several hatcheries send extra chicks that are to be raised and given to a family in need... Have egg chickens? 12 laying hens will give you enough eggs to share with a family that really needs them, without drastically cutting into your egg sales.
Do you sew? Quilt? Crochet? Can you afford to make and donate a few items? Yes? Then do so. 
Offer a hand up, not a hand out. The family you reach out too is already hurting and most likely feeling shame about their situation if they have any pride at all. You can neither buy or force allegiance, you have to earn it. A full stomach, a warm coat, the occasional odd job for cash (even something you normally would do yourself), letting their children have a safe place to grow/play/learn...
There is a place for all of us in WN. Some of us due to age or physical infirmity can't be front line storm troops anymore. Some do not have the eloquence to be proper orators and public statesmen. Some of us are as cash poor as those we should be reaching out to... ALL of us, in our own unique ways, have something of value to offer our people. Find yours, live it. Mine is to be a farmer, an educator, a healer, the traditional role of the 40+ European male. Too crippled up to fight, too disgusted with modern society to die and let it slide further away.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Unlearn, thanks. You hit the nail on the head. We have to take back this country. One of the reasons conservatives are ignored is that the liberal media portrays them as mean spirited. Few conservatives are but lets face it, anyone who goes around like a Nazi gives the liberal media much to ridicule. Ok, if someone wants to hate, to show hate, that is fine in the sense that being hateful is not against the law, unless someone's hate is manifested in illegal action. But that person is not going to be listened to by the majority of Americans. We have to get the majority of American to vote good men and woman into office. We have to get rid of the liberals who are destroying us. Showing hate might make on feel good but it is selfish in the sense that it does nothing to help what should be our cause, bringing back the great values that made the usa the most fantastic nation that ever was or will be.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Nepotism has become a dirty word in the White Vocabulary. This has been largely due to the efforts of our competitors (who control the media) to make Whites less competitive. Yet they shamelessly and openly practice Nepotism. Moreover, so do our Asian competitors. 
I read an article that, in this economy, employers rely on their employees to head-hunt great new prospective employees. So, if you are a valued employee at a place and you know of an opening and you know another highly skilled Whites who would make a great fit at your place of employment, you should have your friend submit an application and highly recommend him to your manager.
I might add that this is the way Mexicans have managed to carve out a niche for themselves in the Southwest. They are positioned to know when a vacancy is about to open, they notify another Mexican who could do the job and they then recommend him to management. That vacancy rarely to never goes public (or if it does, it is for appearances only, because the candidate has already been settled on).
If you get a job through a friend's recommendation, make a point to do such good work and be such an exemplary employee that when another vacancy is about to open, you will be in a position to play the favor forward to another White friend.

Nepotism is not a ""dirty word"", it's illegal for White employers... unless they've already met their ""diversity"" hiring requirements. Non-whites can practice it with impunity as there is no such thing as having too many ""minorities"". In fact, businesses made up entirely of non-whites are perfectly legal.
Only businesses having fewer than 15 employees are exempt from anti-discrimination laws, or if the business is entirely family owned and operated.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


We definitely need more people to read Success Through A Positive Mental Attitude. I read it over and over. It has changed my life. I have a blog I recently started called The Positive White Christian. The link is in my profile if anyone is interested. No amount of ideology, philosophy, religion, or brains can help a man with the wrong attitude.Thank you for this post.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Thanks OP for this post. Unfortunately our ideology is as blended as the mixture of minorities in this country. Talk of having a land of our own while that land already exists in other countries. The land we want is US soil which we rightfully stole in the first place. The class battle is all that is left to win so while we try to hold down other races we really are only holding ours down. Stop the violence and hate and help your fellow White man no matter where they are economically. Would rather see an inbred idiot like Rand who is pure than another Jew lover in charge. When the White race can't agree on what we are fighting for than what are we fighting for?

The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Our biggest challenge is that we must change the false media negative portrayed media image from haters, racist and bigot in something positive and good. We must become heroes for ours fellow whites and we must fight and give them confidence and safe to be with us his genetic borders.
Racily motivated crimes form groups of skinhead KKK do not help and even put an unclimbable wall between us and ordinary white peoples. They are brainwashed daily by media and we can not do anything more then to wake up some real leaders and values for us.
We need really white heroes and not least models of personal example in our fight for our race!
It involves work and involvement and victory is hard to achieved in an Zionist controlled media but not doing noting is not a choice to accept our destruction. So we better fight for our race than wait our destruction and be classified as traitors by our kids and ancestors.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


It really always has been essentially positive as anybody who has ever picked up a history book or understands non-white races ""cultures"" and/or seen the way they commonly behave becomes both very aware of the enormous contributions the European/White race has made to the world's cultural store,comparatively speaking,and how much more developed white cultures are compared to all others.And finally how much more developed we are as human beings than the other non-white races.
There is sooo much positivety about us we are virtually overflowing with it.And of course to have great pride in and love for our grand heritage,culture & peoples is the very essence of White Nationalism.So naturally we would seek to preserve and protect these things,but which however our enemies have unfairly twisted into as mere irrational or blind hatred towards other races.Which in itself would be utterly ridiculous and serve no purpose other than to drain us as human beings and piss off everybody else.The reason for WN is because many amongst the non-white races{two groups in particular come to mind} are greatly hurting us,hurting our people,hurting our women and children and hurting our culture and heritage.
And because our enemies are so fierce and relentless in this determination to fill us full of guilt & shame,self-hate and self-destruction-and of course not to mention their relentless attacks on Nazism and any Race groups promoting racial truth and self-preservation-we can hardly move forward and continue to develop with such a menacing people amongst us,nay,in power over us!
In order to heal our wounds or start anew and build off what we have already achieved historically we must first and foremost deal with the cancer that plagues our entire body,only then are we free again to move forward and develop as a people.If a person has a severe disease,the disease must first be removed before they can heal,returning to their natural healthy state and then they can develop from there.
The negativity dragging and holding us down must be removed before the positivety inside us can truly grow and flourish again.
This was said a long time ago and it is no less true today,in fact it is more true than ever!The Jewish disease that plagues us as a people is 100 times worse today than it was in the 1920's and 30's and we would have to obviously take the most severe measures to combat such a severe and insidious problem.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism




Having just read this entire thread, I must say that this new guy is very impressed.
Although it seems to me that few things unite a group like a common enemy, a culture based solely on fear and hate attracts unstable elements that quickly turn on others within the group once enemies have been vanquished.
I believe the white race has enough skills in our toolbox to make it. Let the militants be militant, the social do-gooders do good socially, the tinkerers tinker, and the old men on the mountain philosophize.
White people, undiluted, will prosper. This thread gives me hope.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


White Nationalism is a tool to distract the increasingly exploited White middle class and lower middle class from those who wish to destroy their standard of living, the HNWI whom are predominately White.
The White whose ancestor was a Yeoman farmer is as different to these elites as a Black America from Harlem.
White poverty generally exists as pockets in major cities, it also exists in entire counties.
Millions of foreigners whose combined net worth is less than the Walton family does not endanger your communities let alone your race. A systematic attempt by the elite to concentrate their wealth by appropriating what would have been the middle classes is what is compromising your livelihoods.

White Nationalism is the antidote to this problem, not a distraction. White Nationalism opposes these ""elites"" you speak of who have systematically destroyed our people by importing nonwhites in order to provide their industries with cheap labor.
Yes they are the problem, and the non-whites that they have imported and continue to import are the problem, just as a broken faucet and a flooded bathroom are the problem. We must fix both the root and the symptom if we are to begin healing as a people.
This thread isn't about identifying the problem; it is about focusing on what we have, what we love, and what we can do to help.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


White Nationalism seeks to liberate our people from the rich and preserve our heritage & culture at the same time. We believe that separate nations according to race is healthy for all races. The forced mixing of the races is Communism and only equals the Genocide of all the races on Earth.
However I agree all the races on Earth share a common enemy. The New World Order's main objective is the theft of ALL OUR MONEY and the enslavement of all people on Earth. All the races on Earth share that common enemy.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


 For white nationalism to have a political future we must find a way to get rid off the media classification of skinhead haters. We must also w convince those skinheads that in not an good way to fight for your race just being an hatter.
The only way to achieve that is to build and popularize heroic white nationalists that involve in white society, and show will and effort to change it for our white people.
Here are my ideas: Involvement in white society in local communities especially, and will to resolve social problems of white brooders.
Organization of paramilitary organization and even local militia that will fight with nonwhite infractors. They will replace the corrupted law and order police and government institution when they do not react for whites and our wrights.
Informing the white of discrimination of the government against them and promovation of immigrants instead of them!
Finding way to protect whites rights when they are discriminated in all legal ways.
Showing all lies of politicians in face of their voters and active accuse them of using lies to get in important position on the government.
Offer our white boorders solutions that really solve problems in efficient ways, and that really change society, not just demagogic discourses.
Civilian militia that have training to and help white victims of our nonwhite enemies, like white women from, sexual assault and rape!
Ways to fight hight criminality in nonwhite areas!

The goal of this post is to create a cohesive strategy for awakening our people and eventually generating a modern European cultural renaissance. It is less of a nuts-and-bolts solution, and is more of an over-arching philosophy and lifestyle, an ethos for white nationalists to follow which will allow solutions to occur and to move us forward towards the results that we want. 
These ideas aren't necessarily things that I invented. I am attempting to synthesize, for your benefit, many ideas from national philosophy, psychology, marketing, and elsewhere into a set of ideals that I know will work if we can hold ourselves to them. I'm calling it ""Positive White Nationalism"" for lack of a better term at the moment. So what is PWN and what are the core ideas that make it work? Lets explore...:-Concentrate on Solutions, Not Problems 
It has been proven that people will subconsciously move toward what they concentrate on. If that happens to be what they don't want, then they will move in that direction whether they like it or not. I remember back when I was a teen, my driving instructor told us ""not to look at big trucks beside you on the highway; you'll steer right into them."" It's a nice metaphor for many things in life. Whatever you feed in your life with your attention, that is what your mind will go to work on. If we can steer ourselves towards the solutions, and not the problems, then that will at least get us pointed in the right direction. 
Speaking to many of you, I can tell that you are depressed. It seems that so many in our society are... and no wonder: so much of our society is grim. Hearing something bad or hearing about a problem creates a sensation of anger. Anger, when not acted upon, leads to feelings of frustration. This can be especially acute in men. Frustration, when built up enough, leads to feelings of futility, helplessness, and powerlessness, which is essentially ""depression"". To prevent this, you can either channel your feelings of anger into activity, or you can dial back the input of negative information. I'm proposing that people do both. By concentrating on the solutions, you focus your attention away from negative input, while at the same time encouraging you to act in a way that alleviates your anger in a constructive manner.-Reframe the Negative and Find the Positive 
On the surface this feels like such a juvenile thing. There is so much negative. We are truly facing the extinction of what most of us hold most dear. It feels overwhelming. Crushing. To ""pretend"" to be positive sounds ridiculous. I'm not talking about pretending. It may feel that way slightly at first. I'm talking about truly making the effort to find the positive in situations. It's always there. I can promise you that. Let me give you an example: say you read an article about a film and it's very anti-white. Instead of concentrating on that and talking about it, look for a film that isn't anti-white or even has pro-white messages. They do exist. The Invasion (2007) was packed full of underlying messages that support our views (which is why critics hated it!). 
I'm not condoning ignorance here, I'm saying that we can't get anywhere if we focus on the negative. Negative thoughts can be highly addictive. They will also destroy you and poison your life. Acknowledge the problems, but don't feed them. Push forward. 
The other benefit to this is that it makes our movement (and you as an individual) 1000 times more attractive to outsiders. You simply cannot attract people with a negative movement. Even in Germany, it wasn't the anti-Semitic rhetoric that got the German people on board, it was the hope, the positive message of unification and prosperity in the face of a destitute and broken future for the working class. We know that things are bad. Lets aim toward a future that works instead of wasting our energies on a past that we cannot change. I realize that at times it can be hard to enjoy your life because it seems like ""what's the point if it's all going out the window"". We all need to find ways to enjoy our lives though, and pull our thinking out of the venomous death spiral.-Lift your Own Race Up, Don't Push Others Down
If we want to spin our wheels trying to disparage other races while our own gets wiped off the map, then I say we deserve to die. It is futile and idiotic. We need to be helping out our own people, not doing petty sniping at others. Don't waste your energies on them. Let them do their own thing. They don't concern us. We concern us. Try doing real-world activities to help your white community. Be prepared to fight, but put your efforts into things that actually help in the present. Add value to your community, instead of take from it. Make money so you can support causes. Be an example of what is good so others can follow it. Find locals that are in need and organize a function to tackle that need. Celebrate what is good and amazing about our own culture instead of trying to point out what is bad about other cultures. That is attractive to people. That makes people want to experience and value the things that we value about our race. The only way we're going to create enough unity among our people to overcome the massive challenges ahead of us is to make them care about who they are. The only way we're going to do that is by showing and demonstrating all of the good qualities of our race. Bringing down someone else might make you feel good temporarily, but it makes you look bad and it undermines your message. Be the best that you can be in your life. You represent us!-Actions, Not Words
Whenever you can, force yourself to take an action, rather than make a rant or post something. It might sound weird, but say, upon hearing something that especially makes you sad and angry about race... maybe about a child getting hurt: instead of just wallowing in that, force yourself to do something. I don't mean seek out the guy that hurt the child and gun him down, I mean something constructive. 
Maybe your neighbor has a child that likes motorcycles. Invite your neighbor and his kid over and let the child help you fix yours while his dad and you drink a beer. I don't know. Something. Anything. Any positive action towards another white person is better than thoughts or futile posts against another non-white. 
Do it right away though. Don't give your anger time to settle inside you. Let it force you to act. We are designed to act! We are biological machines of action. Spend some time in the PLE posts and see that action speaks louder than words. You will feel so much better, your race will thank you, and the world will look upon us in a better light.
I realize that alot of this feels a little alien and perhaps cheesy. I myself, am a fighter by instinct, and alot of this goes against what I am ingrained to think, but in a sense, this IS fighting. It's fighting against the void that is threatening to swallow us up. 
Roll up your sleeves and take the 3 week PWN challenge: What is the 3 week PWN challenge you ask?... 
I challenge all stormfronters, including myself, to not post a single negative post for 3 weeks. Challenge yourself to find the positive. Challenge yourself to find a solution. Ask yourself, are you content to stew in a present where we are a doomed people, or are you willing to make the effort to at least try to move us in a different direction? You have nothing to lose. In the words of Jerry Maguire: ""Who's coming with me?"" 


Agreed.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


I saw some earlier posts from a banned user about how we need to be just like Golden Dawn. The problem is that when you focus on being the best political movement rather than being a good person, your political movement ends up being laughable and invalid - especially when your political movement uses violent means when it is not necessary.
Unlearn's PWN is a great idea because it not only allows us to improve the quality of our own lives by thinking positively, but it also draws more white people to the movement because they say, ""Hey, those smelly, scrawny, leftist druggies with their ethnic friends seem really annoying and pissed off. Let's go hang out with these kind, productive, highly intelligent and cultured white nationalists instead!"" 
Jared Taylor is a great example of this (sadly, he never criticizes Jews, which is mind boggling since they're the source of the problem). He always has a smile on his face, he dresses well, he speaks well, he is kind to the very same people he hopes will soon be deported from our country because to do otherwise would be seen as aggressive or intimidating.
This doesn't mean being naive or ""soft,"" but rather, only using harsh words or violence when there is no other alternative. I think that I have sparked people's interest in white nationalism when I explain why the movement attracts me, rather than talking about how I hate interacting with non-whites every time I go out to eat or go shopping. Nobody honestly wants to interact with them! They're just afraid to say it! Nobody wants to make small talk with them at the local Best Buy or need to repeat eight times the way in which they want your sandwich prepared!
Anyway, I think we need to use factual evidence in a professional and responsible way to get where we want to be. Helping circulate educational texts on white nationalism and the way in which Jews divide and conquer nations would be an excellent start. Also, inviting potential white nationalists to concerts or dinners or panels would be a way to get people interested. 
PWN sounds very constructive to me.

It's not only the face of skinheads that need to be changed, it's the stigma attached to being proud to be white that needs to change. We should be able to support our own race publicly without being ridiculed and punished. Times have changed and people must carry themselves in a way that allows us to be heard, seen and understood without upsetting those who take offence, it's near impossible.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism




Face the Nation With Bob Schaefer 8/24/2014
Bob asked Congressman Paul Ryan about a quote in his book ""The Way Forward"", concerning the Republican effort to shut down the government over Obamacare.
The quote says -""In short, the strategy our colleagues were promoting was flawed from beginning to end; it was a suicide mission, but alot of members were more afraid of what would happen if they didn't jump off the cliff.""
Bob asked why he didn't say that back when it was happening; and Paul Ryan's answer is something that we ALL could take a lesson from.
Ryan responded by saying the following: 
""Because I wanted Party UNITY. I don't think it was constructive for conservatives to be harping at each other; at the same time the purpose of that passage was to try and UNIFY our Party. I don't think we can succeed, if all we do is criticize, and define what we are AGAINST. ""
Just a little peak into, one of, the strategies used within party politics. We could definitely take a lesson here. Bickering and squabbling about non-essential matters, just doesn't matter. Who cares what religion someone is? You can't stop anyone from believing whatever they want in their hearts. What matters is UNITY. Doesn't matter which group you belong to, or if your ""mission statements"" don't particularly line up. UNITY is the answer. If you're White, YOU'RE IN, period. That is the way forward. 
How many different ideologies do you think exist within the NAACP? Yet, when it comes down to race, they are most definitely united; and garner the support of those on the fringes of their movement, based solely on that. What about the different jewish ideologies? Yet, they are first and foremost jewish
. 
We need to put our Aryan heritage first and foremost, and all the other stuff will work itself out. 
Goal number ONE is UNITY. Accomplish this, then move on.
ARYAN AMERICAN ALLIANCE (just an idea) 
CORE BELIEF 1: ARYAN UNITY. GOAL: To be recognized as a racial group ""Aryan American"", with the freedom of self-determination that other racial groups possess; such as African American, or Israeli American, etc. We desire the freedom to love, and express that love, of/for our Culture within our Architecture, Music, Art, Religion(s), Educational Institutions, etc. Our Racial Identity is of the utmost importance for it's continuation. 
Just thinking out loud here.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


I just read this article. Sums it up nicely.Who was Adolf Hitler? By Jost Turner  April 20th is the birthday of Adolf Hitler, who is certainly unequaled as the most vilified and maligned individual in recent history. The current hate campaign against Adolf Hitler is so all-pervasive that even some who claim to be his ardent admirers are so only because they perceive him in the Hollywood and Time-Life image-a slobbering race-hater screaming for White Power.
But Adolf Hitler was hardly a White Power leader or a race hater. He was far too great, his insight far too keen, and his missions far too important for him to be afflicted with the petty hatreds and vanities common to lesser men. He was too selfless, too self- disciplined, too responsible to have anything in common with the Hollywood, and hence the White Power image of today.
Adolf Hitler came from the common Folk, and as a young man he lived in poverty in the slums of Vienna. But he was consumed with the vision of a Golden Age, a healthy, beautiful, peaceful time when mankind lives in harmony with the immutable laws of Nature. His vision of the Golden Age was intensified when he listened to the music of Richard Wagner. Through the music of Wagner and his highly developed intuition, he recognized that the purpose of all mankind was higher evolution, and that this had been long forgotten and replaced by selfishness and materialism. He clearly saw the great need for a true Folk-community where his Folk could live in harmony with the laws of Nature and begin the process of higher evolution, and he felt duty bound to bring this about.
During World War One, Adolf Hitler served in the German Army with great honor. He was wounded, gassed, and awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class for heroism. After the war, he worked for the Army, investigating the various political parties which were springing up in opposition to the Marxist movement-which he knew was created by International Finance to enslave his Folk once and for all. He attended a meeting of the German Workers Party, and was pleasantly surprised by their comprehension of the covert goals of International Finance. He learned that this party was secretly sponsored by the Thule Gemeinschaft (Thule Society), an impressive underground organization of German academics and businessmen who, like Adolf Hitler, were interested in a Folk-community and the higher evolution of their Folk.
He joined the German Workers Party, which soon changed its name to the National Socialist German Workers Party. The party adopted the Thule Gemeinschaft's symbol, the Swastika, and in short order Adolf Hitler as the leader and primary spokesman. From every class and position of his Folk he built a disciplined and efficient political party, which also functioned as a Folk- movement. Party members were taught to look out after one another, and inter-party goods and services were provided whenever possible for those in need. Unlike the Marxists, who were bankrolled by International Finance, the National Socialist Party was financed by the meager, but freely given, contributions from the German Folk. In 13 years and 4 1/2 months, Adolf Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany. His popularity was such that he could not be denied political power. His popularity grew even more after he had come to power. Instead of persecuting his enemies, he converted them to supporters. He solved Germany's massive unemployment in short order, and then proceeded to build a new Germany of beauty, culture, and economic stability-much in the image of his vision of the Golden Age. Unlike other national leaders, dictators or democratic, he submitted all of his programs to the vote of the German Folk-and always received a staggering majority. The social and economic miracles of National Socialist Germany-which no honest investigator can deny-are a monument to his genius, insight, and leadership.
But the only way Adolf Hitler could transform Germany was to defy the dictates of International Finance by taking Germany off the international banking system and printing his own money, based not on gold, but on the productivity of the German worker. This was a deadly blow to the power of International Finance! 
Using both the Marxist and Capitalist nations, both of which it controlled, International Finance soon retaliated by launching the most vicious and bloody war in history. In their fever to destroy Adolf Hitler and save their evil money monopoly, no method was too underhanded, no lie too loathsome. Women and children were butchered, raped, and burnt, and beautiful cities were turned into charred rubble. Even against such overwhelming odds, Adolf Hitler almost fought them to a standstill-which would have forced them to negotiate for peace. Unfortunately, the enemy within, egoism was silently at work. The German officer corps, many of whom could not tolerate the accomplishments and leadership of a mere corporal, betrayed him-and Germany-at a crucial hour. They treacherously aided the armies of International Finance in getting a toehold on the coast of France. After that, it wasn't long before the raping and looting hordes overran Germany and her few allies. 
But for those who understand his real significance, Adolf Hitler remains an inspiration for the survival of this world. It is not laws, demonstrations, nor armed revolutions, which shape the future of the planet. No, the change must be within. As can be clearly seen in the successes of our enemies, more has been accomplished in the classrooms than from any law, demonstration, or revolution. Laws can be changed, demonstrations are forgotten, and revolutions become corrupt, but the inner awareness of mankind-or the lack of it-molds the future.
Adolf Hitler inspired the German Folk to an inner change. He inspired them to selflessness, to will, to responsibility-a Golden Age consciousness. He led them in building a great Folk- community for future generations of their Folk, and he began the process of higher evolution through intelligent breeding, education, and investigation of the Golden Age methods of higher evolution by self-effort. Even toward the end of the war, National Socialist expeditions were investigating these methods in the mountains of Northern India. 
His vision of a Golden Age, when mankind is much higher evolved and lives in harmony with Nature, gives us an indication of the true nature of Adolf Hitler. To so uniquely realize the importance of higher evolution for this world of chaos clearly requires one whose realizations come from a much higher state of awareness. His lack of egoism, his dauntless will, his astounding intuition, his amazing intellectual comprehension of virtually any subject, his overriding kindness, and his dynamic magnetism to friend and foe alike all indicate an individual of higher evolution. 
Adolf Hitler was indeed the forerunner of a new race- a more highly evolved race which will come and which will lead all mankind back into harmony with Nature. Only one of higher evolution could have ignored the temptations of ego, selfishness, and materialism - - the motivations of the Churchill's, Roosevelt's, and Stalin's of the world-and make the awesome accomplishments which he did. 
Unfortunately, there are too many today who claim to be National Socialists, but who only demonstrate their Time-Life National Socialism with fantasy uniforms, White Power T-shirts, Swastika banners, childish telephone messages, and rag-sheets with crude racial slurs and poorly thought-out political and revolutionary fantasies. All that these movement maggots accomplish is to play right into the hands of their proclaimed enemies by further obscuring the true nature of National Socialism. This accomplishes nothing at all toward the higher evolution of mankind. Neither does this honor Adolf Hitler nor the millions who died trying to defend a place on this earth where higher evolution could flower en masse. 
Adolf Hitler's great significance is that he proclaimed and demonstrated the principles on which we must base our communities in order to survive, prosper, and to evolve. The task of National Socialism today is to continue in his footsteps toward the higher evolution of mankind. We must begin realistically, without fanfare, starting at the family level and slowly building to the community level, developing and raising our own evolution while inspiring our friends and neighbors to follow. National Socialism is the path of responsibility, will, and self-discipline toward a new Golden Age.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Two more camping areas cleared and set aside for down on their luck white families to use. Another large garden area is mowed, has irrigation, and is available for any WN to use free of charge. The chickens are laying enough eggs now, and the deer/feral hog herds are large enough to support a couple families in need. Native fall foods are ready for any white family that needs them, just come get them.
No monetary outlay for any struggling white family that is going hungry. You can use our farm equipment, I have an extra truck available, we have an older motorhome and an older tag along camper that can be refit for living space if needed. 
The local schools, while not great, are not atrocious. There are town jobs available, low paying, but something is better than nothing. You will have to help out on the farm while looking for income generating employment and a permanent residence. We're always in need of carpenters, arborists/orchardists, gardeners, livestock tenders, equipment operators, etc on the place. If you want to set up a produce, cut flower or craft stand, or sell to those in the area, we can make that happen.
Our farm, though small, is dedicated to preserving a more traditional European way of life, and that includes assisting our racial kin... Times are tough. Money is tight. Bellies are empty. We aren't as well off as some, but, what we have we make available.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


I've been away from the forum for quite a while, and what a pleasure it was to come back and see this thread! I strongly believe in presenting a positive message in order to get our point across, especially in dealing with the media. 
A few months ago I saw a news clip which featured someone interviewing a man who was a part of the WN. I believe that the piece was regarding an attempt at an all White town and identified him as a member of a local KKK group, but I could be misremembering. The newscasters were of course very disparaging of the clip, mocking anyone who would stand up for his (White) race as a racist idiot. What impressed me was that our man expressed fairly well what has been discussed here--that we're not about hating anyone else, but in protecting and being proud of our own race. He wasn't as prepared as I could have hoped to deal with the expected baiting questions from the interviewer, but I thought it was a good start and that he hopefully got some White viewers thinking.
Speaking to the media in a positive, prepared way will let us reach some of our people no matter how much the media tries to slant it. So will acting as positive role models, as other posters have said far better than I could have. Negative attacks just cause people to ""circle the wagons"" and become even stronger in defense. I know that when the media mocks this site or the Cause I always come running back here in support. 
Just my thoughts.

Hey all. I've taken a little break myself, but am glad to see this thread still going strong. Keep it up!
Keep in mind, I'm not advocating using manipulation tactics or ""putting on a nice face"" to sucker people in. We're not a cult or an extremist group. We are normal, healthy-minded people who have refused to accept that 2+2=6. The West has gone mad, and it is our burden to show the path back to sanity and give people hope that our great race isn't content to lay down and die.
Do not bow low and feel like you need to skulk in the corners. Be a true example of the best that you can be, strengthen your community with good deeds, and the rest will take care of itself.

To the OP, your statements are spot on!!
We need ""Wolves in sheep's clothing"". In order to get our ""on the fence"" friends to understand, accept, and embrace our ideas we need people who can share them with charisma.
The jews have their movie stars, the blacks have their civil rights leaders, and athletes. We need our ""faces"". You can draw more flies with honey than you can with vinegar, but the best draw is BS. As WN we are the minority, but with the proper image, we can draw more of our white brothers and sisters home. 
We also need to show our pride, and not just talk about it. We need to raise the bar on what people think of when they think of WN. People need to know that we are successful. Image is more important now than ever.

""Camp Stormfront"" is open.
Pond is well stocked. Garden areas are ready to use. Pecan and fruit trees appear to be setting crops (mulberries ready next week). Will be planting next week, as a freak storm curtailed finish tilling today.
What is ""in it"" for Stormfront members in good standing? A chance to be old time White. A chance to meet and greet each other, with no pressures or outside influences in the way. A place to get away from the modern world, relax and reboot.
What can you do here, for free: Primitive camping. Fishing, small boating and swimming in a well stocked 2+ surface acre pond. Small bore shooting (instruction available). Make a wooden bow. Hunt for wild foods (nuts, fruits, fungi, ginseng and other medicinals, game animals). Learn about chickens, ducks, horses. Learn to operate and/or repair gasoline and diesel fueled equipment. Metal detecting, this has been a working farm since the 1790s. Traditional forge. 
Okay, what is the ""real"" cost? Nothing. If you enjoy your stay and want to help out, great, but it is neither expected or required. If you'd like to put in some sweat equity to help us expand the camping areas, gardens, maintain the orchards, or dry/vacuum pack excess production for donation through F.A.W.N., great, glad to have you. But again, it is neither expected or required. I'm not offering this facility, or anything it has on it, as a money making scheme. I'd rather see our families, the families of Stormfront members, putting it to good use.
What should I bring? Tent, food, drinking water if you don't want to haul if from the well. An open mind, and a willingness to try something new wouldn't hurt.
As always, access granted via the private message system, only, unless you are one of the rare few who have my real world contact info. I can pick up folks from the airport or the Amtrak terminal if necessary. 
Yours in service to our race.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism




Actually there is no negative White nationalism? White nationalism is just love to own Race and Nation! Only White nationalism is banned, we have muslim nationalists who have pure muslim countries, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Albania etc... Israel is purest Jewish country by percents, there is about 98% of Jews, only white countries are full of non white scum!
So, at final this is our fault and we must correct this, aware white people must go out on streets and protest, every white land, every white Continent must wake up and be aware of consequences if we not stand up and protest at least hand!
Everybody are delighted when they see on TV how blacks in Africa keep their identity, even white people are delighted, ''something like modern hippies'' However, when white man show pride because he is white, everybody want to hang him!
Prosecutions for being pride on white skin, for being Aryan must be stopped! We are proud same as we always and I am glad for God made me white!

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Yes! We must have a positive mental attitude if we are going to win, and I'm certain we will. We can research and discuss our positive Histories with our young people. Discussions on science and Literature should include the Greeks, Aristotle Archimedes, plato, Astronomy, Art, Pythagorus, who invented the right triangle formulae and more. The Sparta story is how we can show bravery and pride of our race, we are not selfish but self sacrificing and the enemies don't want us to even realize this is our strength, but it is an awesome strength. 
We have Shakespeare who wrote great plays they do not want to teach them to our children anymore. 
I remember some of those things my father used to do was to read Edgar Allen poe and Shakespeare to me as a kid and weird tales of Science fiction and stories of our white heroic epic tales like iliad and odyssey and it filled me with pride and hope and i learned what was right from the story. Most kids today miss this experience and liberals are calling this an unfair advantage! They are asking white parents to stop reading to kids incredible. Moral values and much is learned by our stories. We are our stories and they are us, and we must never allow the enemies of our people to steal our stories. The television and movies have replaced our heroic epics where the White man and women are the heroes who save the day and rescues or makes a sacrifice to save someone and make a depressing thing where everyone dies at the end. They make our people look stupid and their ignorant losers and negroes are the heroes nothing could be further from truth. My parents allowed me to hear all my grandparents stories too its important, if they are not around find other old folks with good stories. Positive stories are so important for our young people.

That is sad it was similar with my father so many years ago, and he mockingly said i should vote for David Duke. He only thought of David Duke as somewhat of a racist or extremist and so he was calling me the same. Too bad it took me so long to learn more about Dr Duke because we did not have the internet then and we had to rely only on newspapers and media. I was witnessing the end of our race and i was concerned and wanted to read and talk about it with my father we often talked political matters, religious and economics. 
Its the word 'White' the media has made this a trigger word and if we do not use it and just emphasize our heritage. And history our european tribe or ethnicity family etc. to replace the word it sounds less like anything they can condemn as racist. Our cultural and religion is under attack and families are under constant assault. Being proud and confident young white male is likely to get you accused of being boastful arrogant in the least and and when that doesn't shut you up they attack with 'you're a RACIST' by the usual enemies of our folk but it hurts the most at home or from our friends, And our enemies know this and convince so many people of the mental pseudoscience of psychiatry and fake racism its like a bogey man its just mot there in the majority of cases, its just a proud strong young white man standing up for himself.

Negative. The most effective move is the silent one. So you must become a Silent Option for our policy. Is this not why we failed? How could the ones who subverted the Former Christendom (West) beat if from the front? They didn't..they had a network of traitors from within. You cannot beat them frontally, there are unnofficial laws that you must obbey. Make the Law, Respect the law, or Deal with the consequences. Refer to the first step.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Great post
There are just some very important things missing:
There are almost certainly more of us (white nationalists, not all on stormfront) in the EU than there are muslims; I'd guess around 10 million, and personally I think that's a very conservative estimate. If we got our act together and started reproducing, there would be no problems conserving our race.
All too often, I hear from others how there is no point having children, since the world is now a very bad place. They are part of the problem! The world is a great place; its getting worse, yes, but that is reversible. Too many people focus on the negative side; the white race is not doomed, and if you continue to believe that, and give up, then you are helping doom it.
Do you know how ridiculous population growth can be these days? Almost everyone now lives long enough to reproduce. If all of you have lots of children, and they have lots of children, etc., our numbers would swell incredibly within the century. E.g. if all of us have 4 children, (and stick to our community of 10 million in the EU) at ages 25,27,29,31, we could say we roughly have 4 children at age 28, and we can estimate our population to double every 28 years; in 112 years time, we'd roughly have a population of 160 million. There are more than enough of us to replenish the white population; its only a matter of will power - finance isn't as much of an issue as you'd imagine, especially in countries that are desperate for young blood, e.g. Germany.
Of course, there is no point having children if you can't raise them well. Too many people are not prepared to take the hit to their living standards to give their own children the best chance in life. Too many men expect their wives to do the dirty work. Remember: every effort you make for your children, is an effort invested in the future of the white race, and vice versa.
All to often, we have white nationalists using violence against minorities and lefties. This is an idiotic move, scoring an own goal. Not only does it turn public opinion against us, it also gets the nationalists locked up in prison, where they'll die childless, all the while being a drain on our resources.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Positive White Nationalism
White Nationalism is an ideology that promotes a racialist idea of national identity feeling that you need to be proud of your heritage and your people with out advocating hate towards others. Some examples of White Nationalism Are a shared group of ideas seeking significance of a geographical and sometimes demographic seeking independence for our culture and ethnicity that holds our group together especially our European culture. I'm very proud of my heritage as I have quite a lot of relatives in Australia who were from England originally and some are from Wales, I'd love to travel around Europe sometime cause that's where my ancestors come from and I'm very proud to have European heritage in my background . White Nationalism has a long tradition in English speaking countries. According to one view it is a product of the modern centralised state emergence in the West like all nationalism. The term originated as a self descriptive term by some groups primarily in the United States in a racially defined collective identity of white or Caucasian people. White Nationalists say that every nationality feels a natural affection for it's own kind. Thus they believe in a common identity, common interests, and common political action for whites. This worldwide is often influenced by late 19th century racial nationalism. Most supporters see White Nationalism refer to political activities with in a country. They have not necessarily rejected there existing national identity and allegiance, nor do they seek to destroy existing . They see themselves as patriotic preservers of European history and culture. Some white nationalists support a territorial defined white separatism, the belief that white and non white people should reside in separate and not just lead separate social lives. However some other forms of white separatism proposed by white nationalists take the form of far reaching racial segregation within an existing national state. White nationalists in the united states may appeal historical precedents for there beliefs. Many past Americans held views which would now be considered taboo.

i am european, from croatia, but i am not one of those hard core nationalists, cause i believe that our race is more important than nationality...i would always rather choose to be white, no matter which nationality than for example to be mixed croatian or mixed english...nationalists in my country are mostly focusing on national subjects and they are not pro white, i know so many of them who claim to be nationalists but would for example gladly bang some latino,asian or black women.. the awareness of our race in croatia is so low, so croatian nationalist not bother much about white race and all issues we are dealing...many of them will even vote for so called right or far rights parties, even those parties are the ones who are responsible for so bad economic situation and they are so corrupted...so in my opinion nationalism should be on second place and our white race and european culture on the first place...also, i think that all white countries world wide and here in europe should stand together so that all issues can be solved much easier, specially now with these rats coming to europe.i am not for hating others, but i am strongly for making clear who we are and that we are not same,cause european culture is far more ahead than others in global...i think white people should create some kind of global white organisation so that we have legal pro white party who can then work in every country as independent party but with same goal, our white race.cause so far there s been to many **** against white nations and white people and jews just take profit from that kind of situation to divide us more.

I am fairly new here, and I wanted to say that this post and the ideas posited in it have inspired me. I have been struggling with severe depression and rage that stems from the problems our folk are having in the current world for a while, and it has been having noticeably negative effects on me. Thank you for inspiring me to focus on and emulate the positive aspects of our folk, and less on the negatives that I see outside. Of course it is important to know and combat assaults against our people, but I can see how focusing on that entirely is counter-productive. I will do my best and attempt to become better in every way I can every day. I wish the best for us all, and hope you all find strength in all ways.
Best wishes,

I liked this. 
While it's fine to vent negative emotions and complaints here and with close friends, what we project to the rest of the world in real life is what really counts. And you're absolutely right that it has to always be positive- the moment anyone expresses a negative sentiment you expose yourself to the perception of insecurity or weakness...
A lot of us don't realize how much power we actually have, how much of the momentum is already on our side. We don't need to call ourselves 'nationalists' or have 'pride'... those terms in fact were created by white lefty loons for insecure minorities to use. And that's the thing- people don't realize that policies like affirmative action, political correctness, promoting minority identity, etc are all borne of white patronization- nutjob white intellectuals 'feeling bad' for non-whites: Gandhi was trained in England by British intellectuals and his ideas had existed long before through the likes of PM Gladstone during the reign of Victoria; emancipation and the civil rights movement were entirely the works of whites like Lincoln and LBJ. Non-whites did almost nothing in modern history and they still are nothing but tokens, especially the president. I think it is much more powerful, when in public, to express positive sentiments like feeling bad for and being patronizing to non-whites than to hate or be aggressive about them.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


I love the concept. Be positive as an individual too guys. You have to be a positive, strong person inside, and it will reflect outward and summon people to our side. Nobody wants to join a 'movement' of depressed people.
As somebody who came from a non WN family, somehow I woke up before I was even out of high school and really had nobody to talk to. Reading Stormfront and other forums that were around at the time for the past 15 years really wore into my spirits. 
I started to become the loser the media portrays us to be, depressed and beaten. Stuffed my college degree in a box and just was doing all around not well. 
While I haven't been doing anything significant towards our cause, I had to shift gears and do what was significant for me. I quit a pack a day smoking habit, quit pounding coffee and quit drinking completely. I decided I don't want to go into the field I studied in college, so I shifted over to studying computer programming, mathematics, and electronics by myself. I check university course syllabuses and gather the required material and study it on my own now. I'm starting to feel much better, and I realize that its rubbing off on others around me who are motivated by the materialization of these studies into ""cool"" computer programs. My 30s are going to be great, regardless of what happens in the world around me.
People are miserable out there, we need to be positive and make something of ourselves. Others admire that, they will admire us and be far more apt to joining our cause when they believe there is some kind of BENEFIT to it. 
Study guys, read, solve some math problems, get interested in a trade that requires a developed skill. Work on being positive, YOU are just as human as all of the people controlling this world and you can make a difference. Nothing happens in a day, commit yourself to developing yourself first. You have to be strong to inspire others, please don't waste your lives dwelling on what you read in the Newslinks & Articles section!
As an aside, we should all get more active in the quieter sub forums, I should be in the computer talks section. We need to inspire the younger members to take up these activities, because they are being taught to just be lazy and play games at school.

Okay, would this be negative? - ""every solution creates a new problem"" (an axiom of truth?). Perhaps we go looking for it (negativity). ""Every problem is an opportunity in disguise"".Yes, waste of time arguing with or trying to change non-Whites. But we do it on STORMFRONT amongst ourselves, because they say it's a forum (and what else could it be?)If not action, then contribute as best you can.

This is really important! I glossed over this when I originally read your post but have been mulling it over... it really is a profound statement.
We shouldn't need to classify ourselves as anything other than white because ""white"" should be synonymous with white nationalist. Every human is borne a racial/ethnic nationalist. Having pride is normal. Distinguishing between your group and another is normal. It isn't wrong or barbaric or ignorant... it is as natural and vital to the health of a human as is breathing.
Just be white. Don't claim to be a white nationalist, just be a normal person with a healthy amount of pride and don't let anyone try to push that down or make you feel strange for that. Take for granted that being white, or any other race, comes with the natural desire to see your own people do well.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Great Topic and agree very much. Over the years I have always been pro white but when I first discovered SF I had trouble with what I viewed as complaining about other races suppressing whites. It struck me personally as weak and frustrated me. I completely understand the truth behind the comments people make about Jewish supremacy and its effects, I also completely get the negative influences of other racial groups, namely blacks... but I want to have a stringer influence on my family and friends and community. 
To share a positive story of two.. I have had a lot of success in both work life and private life getting people to realize that white culture is different from other cultures and we should never be ashamed or afraid to celebrate it. I have had people try to shame me into speaking against white society and I simply refuse to. I am not ashamed of my ancestors who own slaves, or of running of the Indians or any other 'sin' they try to pin on me. My response... of course there is white privilege... you get that when you win or concur nations. 
I used to love the ""White Pride world wide"" slogan. It hits home for me and resonates with many others. Its not about hate, its all about pride in your people. Its been slow work but many in my family have come around to it even some who were / are toying with Marxism or Bernie sanders style socialism. I simply take the time to calmly explain how they are being played and I never back off misstatements or inaccurate claims. 
I sell tribalism heavy because our family, which is very large, understands that very much.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Unlearn,
I love the post & thread it bred. We need this desperately I was nearly lost because of the hate and self-destructive actions of those I knew. I couldn't take the blind & often misplaced hatred. This thread has given me hope, as have other groups taking a similar approach like the Traditionalist Workers Party (at least their professed ideas). I might not agree with their more socialistic oriented ideas but I do like their more positive message. 
I love my race & I am sick of the anti-white crap that is being openly promoted even more now days. We need to not just repackage our message but find positive ways to reach our people especially the young. With the advances of technology & the internet it is easier to reach out & create positive counteractive messages - if only we take the effort.
Plus as you & others stated - we need to get out & help our poor & struggling folk - minus the lectures. We must just lead by example.
Those of us who can should seek to mentor our troubled & at risk youth in useful trades, in music & our own cultural arts and languages. Learn traditional woodworking or folk music; then pass it on. Start a band that focuses on positive messages but still have powerful lyrics and music to carry them to people. It could be Folk Metal or Folk Punk - but with a pro-white message. Take Dropkick Murphys, they have powerful but often positive messages. If a pro-white band created like styled music but from a pro-white message minus the hate & calls for violence - what kind of impact could they make?
Use the medium of comics - I am not talking about childish super-hero comics with a racial focus but slice of life comics that promote our messages but with engaging stories, interesting characters & great art. The same goes with fictional novels in power sub-genres like Steam Punk, urban fantasy & even sci-fi (Cyberpunk?). Attract intelligent & charismatic, attractive well spoken young men & women who have strong character to host Alt-News & commentary online shows like Lauren Southern & Paul Joseph Watson.

Agreed. What we need to do is re-elevate ourselves. Our focus should be maintaining high stations of society, so that we can ensure the preservation of the culture we've created.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


I agree with everything that you said, but I would add something to the third point (Lift your Own Race Up, Don't Push Others Down). I understand and agree that we should not merely try to bring others down, though part of lifting yourself up will involve pushing others down if the resources are limited. We should do both but wisely, in a balanced manner. Sharing is an impossibility: this is something the brainwashed whites dont understand, that is, that the more we help the others, we whites are sacrificing our quality of life. This is why this is battle. All attacks against others (mainly blacks, the biggest problem by far) should involve only carefully thought arguments without questionable premises. If you do not have good arguments, do not mention any. So, attacking others can be done, but you should be careful not to make a fool of yourself. For most people (those with lack of practice in logic and argumentation), it will be better to focus on helping white people indeed than trying to attack the opponent.Great post! I love the focus on the positivity! Sometimes it is so easy to get down. We need to look at the whole picture and realize that it is not nearly as bad, though it is still crucial since it will only get worse if it keeps like this.

Léon Degrelle referred to ""la race blanche"" on numerous occasions, i.e. whenever idiots in these circles pretend the Third Reich & entire Axis was some sort of 'chauvinism' against Europe, we have historical evidence which proves otherwise. 
Positive White Nationalism entails saving each & every ethnicity in Europe & the formation of a 'greater' Europe of nation states... all aligned with the same racial preservationist goals & working in tandem. 
Failure to achieve these goals will be our failing, not those who came before us. It's time to stop being cowards & assume our natural position as defenders of our continent in this late hour.

Well said. Even though we fought each other throughout history, there was always a racial awareness and a strong thread of ""blood nation"" among Europeans when push came to shove. Racialism was a given much like sleeping and breathing, and it still is behind our modern, feeble, apologetic cowering. It wasn't some new concept invented by 20th century dictators. It isn't some inconvenient anomaly meant to be squashed by the hammer of ""progressive"" utopianism. It's a core component of everyone's humanity. The sooner we can openly admit that, the better off we will be, and the sooner we can move forward.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


You posted a well-written discussion that can help unite many of our people. Especially important is the emphasis on action. Since the beginning of Western civilization, our people have been a lot like herding cats. The one thing that unites our people, however, is action. We have won over the vast majority of Westerners by producing results that they can trust, because not all of us are persuaded primarily by logic. Some of us are persuaded by action (credibility), and others of us are persuaded by inspiration (emotion).
The Stoic School has recognized this from the beginning of Western civilization. We call the ways our people are won over, ""logos, ethos, pathos."" Logos is logic, ethos is credibility (or producing results), and pathos is passion (inspiration/emotion).
The Stoic School has seen the West win over greater crises, such as the Black Plague. Today, the West has a couple paths to victory against anti-Western forces. The victory is ours for the taking. We only need a stronger will, better organization, more energy, and a better appreciation of Western civilization than our opponents. That is what several of our people are providing, including the Stoic School.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


I think White peoples' greatest weakness is how little unity we have. We need to learn to forgive and forget the ancestors of other White people for killing the ancestors of our own White nationality, because until then, we will remain divided, and such division will easily be exploitable by other races. The next important thing to do is set aside our political differences and cooperate regardless of what fellow White nationalists may think about economics, politics, or society. I think the ideological rivalry starting in the early 20th century that lead to so much bloodshed among Whites, and almost caused the end of the world was all part of the plan to bring on white geneocide.

European peoples already have a positive world view and culture that has preserved us through barbarian invasion, the Black Plague, Muslim invasions, and potato famines. Let's not try to reinvent the wheel. The positive way forward is rooted in Stoicism. It is the science and art of Strength. From the birth of Western civilization until our time, our people have returned to authentic Stoicism to get through every crisis. It has always worked and always will, because it is based on our unique biology according to our special kinship determined by Nature and written in our shared genetic haplogroup. Our ancestors have given us the world view that unites our people in common causes and that defeats our opponents, such as barbarians, Marxists, perverts, and reprobates.

We should be proud of our ancestors because we are where we are because of them. Regardless of the bad times and there are plenty, we also have to look at the good they did. I'm of Norse ancestry so some of my ancestors might have been vikings. The stories we hear, the sagas I've read talk about a dark past. I can't however judge them because I never lived in their time. But they struggled to survive and because they survive I live today. Ever people did bad things but that doesn't mean because they did bad things you get to do it yourself.

H. We realize that diplomatically we may have to compromise- but population control is a much under rated goal!!
II. Tribal (Team) Socialism 
**************************
if God let everyone into Heaven, then it wouldnt be Heaven!
****************************
A. Even Geniuses make mistakes. (Killing the Hebrew gods book would have been more effective than killing the individuals)
B. Just as slavery tainted USA
C. Too bad racism tainted National Socialism. 
>>>>>Should we totally trash the constitution because our founders were slave owners?>>>>>
***** Do we totally toss any part of National Socialism just because it made one particular MISTAKE?***
D. Great alternative to Communism or Capitalism - Tribal Socialism is good for the worker.
E. Both Communism and Capitalism culminate in a small percentage living extravagantly off the toil of working majority. TS IS the best for the working majority.
F. For dedication to the tribe - the bare necessities of each member is taken care of(healthcare especially). But you still have individually owned enterprise and competitive drive for individual accomplishments.
G. Capitalism drove a lot of development- but it is dependent on constant consumption and expansion and is not sustainable at current population . 
H. Free enterprise and TRUE market competition is good for most things (car, appliances) - but for healthcare, elderly, primary education) is much more efficient if handled collectively (social). This one small piece of the economy will not devastate the free market system. This makes everyone stronger to participate in a capitalist game (capitalism really is a game that needs SOME rules).
Capitalism is a very NEW GAME which maxes out on human materialistic and selfish desire. At least to an extent, its fairly juvenile/shallow. But a little of this does drive some innovation.
*** On Unbridled Capitalism:**
Have you ever played Make it Take It basketball? We re not ditching free market- all games need to have some rules or they become rediculous. Would you pay to see a football game with NO REFs?! Ponder on it.......
*******************************
(TS are not opposed to keeping a regulated free market with some individual competition- as long as some social responsibility is maintained)
********************************
>> Tribal Socialism just sounds better than the tainted racism of National Socialism.
But the concept is comparable.
******************++++
**Dont let em tell you it cant exist independently from racism! Even geniuses make mistakes.******
*******************************
Just as the American Constitution can include all races - even though it was written by racists. dont throw out Genius because of the one mistake. Harvest the good, toss out the rotten fruit.
**********************************
>>>we recognize DIFFERENCES among RACES. We dont think that RACIAL PRIDE and PRESERVATION has anything to do with Hate or wishing Harm or Mistreatment of other races. Theres no problem with choosing to marry INSIDE your own RACE! People throw it all in one batch - but why is it a crime to live and preserve your particular race?
But the race thing is really just a minor side track. Dont let the current race resurgence block your view of the BIGGER PICTURE. All of humanity can benefit from the Geniuses if we take out the right message.
*****************************
III. Not based on any particular religion 
>>>. Religion is critical even if youre an ATHEIST!! Religion is the inner PURPOSE that guides peoples WILL. It affects everyone- even the NON-BELIEVERS!!<<<<<
***Since recorded history Religion has been ingrained. Do you really think it will cease to exist in any form?? Even in Star Wars there was The Force. Secularism has a point in not letting religion in government- but the Soviets found out eliminating religion is next to impossible.***********
A. Caucasians, Africans, and Asians are Not sons of Abraham- the desert god!! How did this DESERT god wash out the other Earth based Gods??
>>>The Nazis toyed with Occult
>>> The Marxists pushed Atheism.
>>> TS just strives to distance itself from a god that has no Future Plan in Evolution and Environmental sustainability - man as part of nature and not King of it.
B. Man is not any more important than any other creature - man was NOT created in exact image of god. Man is not king of Earth, hes part of it.
C. Man must EARN his immortality!!!
D. The Abrahamic god gives man a pass to desecrate nature and not live in harmony with Nature 
E. TS have an affinity toward Pagan or Earth religion. ( After all: Nordic/Caucasian and Africans were FORCED out of their Earth based Faith! Tell me again that the Hebrew based god is not FASCIST?!)
We only discriminate when a religion causes harm right here in the REAL World- we have a right to stand up to a destructive entity!!
F. We are totally baffled at how the desert god corrupted the Nordic/Germanic people?!
>> Pagans and Darwinism are totally compatible- no conflict 
*************************
Actually: Paganism would not have any of the CONFLICT that Bible thumpers rave about nowadays . Paganism and Eastern Religions would not bog us down in all these complicated and confusing Biblical laws and dogma. Its just a way of dragging along impeding progress!
*******************
Buddhism wasn't meant out to be a ""religion"". 400 years ago (even today in some remote parts of India) caste system was so prevalent and as a result ""worshipping"" was a luxury allowed only to the upper class/caste. Lower caste was not even allowed inside temples.(Remind you any of the Papacy?). Gautam Buddha was himself a king and got tired of this nonsense. He went about preaching that there is no external God that one must go to a temple and pray to...he popularised that the God was INSIDE us, all of us, upper caste, lower caste, all castes. It's cuz of this that he became so popular and his idealogy spread. So much that after his death, his followers gave him the God status cuz of his good deeds in life. This concept of ""one external God"" is exactly what Gautam Buddha was against during his entire life. His actual teaching were about the God within, and to conduct in a way so as be at peace with oneself.
****************************
IV. Geniocracy - rule by highest IQ
Our ultimate will
A. At least an IQ requirement for office.
B. Or at bare minimum a IQ requirement to vote! If democracy is a must. We refuse to let idiots (the majority) decide our laws!
C. Basically Darwinism approach to leadership instead of mob rule.
>> Besides- Democracy is SLOW <
D. Education: public funding for education would be a much more efficient investment if access to college was TOTALLY based on ACADEMICS ACHIEVEMENT instead of how much money your family has. The current system has millions of dollars tied up in worthless degrees. Currently, the smartest people rarely get the access to advanced degrees. Its wasteful and *UnDarwinistic *
Doesnt benefit the advancement of The Tribe!
V. Conservative on Economic and Immigration - Liberal on Social Issues.
A. Homosexuals dont reproduce! Sex for pleasure and not reproduction fits great into the modern situation . For some reason illogical, Sons of Abraham have trouble with sex without reproduction and traditional family?
B. Abortion- we are overpopulated remember ;-)
>>>again-ignorance of birth control causes this whole debate. Sexuality is too taboo to discuss with the Semitic dogma
C. Genetic Engineering 
>>As we approach post-human life and aim toward immortality, we may not keep the same physical form.
D. A.I. Is also part of EVOLUTION and aiming at IMMORTALITY 
VI. Without Biblical doctrine - we must define GOOD and EVIL and give our picture of what HEAVEN is like.
A. Good is that which DECREASES SUFFERING both in Magnitude and Numbers.
Evil is VICE VERSA 
SIMPLE 
** Why would you make morality complicated? Unless youre trying to confuse people? Hmmm. ***
>>ex: Catholic stance on Birth Control has caused overpopulation and INCREASED POVERTY in Latin America. Protestant Countries have higher Standard of Living 
B. HEAVEN is a place where MONEY is totally UNNECESSARY 
C. HELL - there is no use whatsoever for eternal suffering. The closest thing to hell is living with ignorance.
VII. Suicide, Addiction- out of control for a simple reason:
A. Young people have no PURPOSE, Common Goal, and since of BELONGING 
B. The Church is dieing- need something to REPLACE it.(VOID)
>>we dont have to kill the church- its just killing itself (corruption and failure to keep up with the times).
C. Young people dont have enough physical contact.

The goal of this post is to create a cohesive strategy for awakening our people and eventually generating a modern European cultural renaissance. It is less of a nuts-and-bolts solution, and is more of an over-arching philosophy and lifestyle, an ethos for white nationalists to follow which will allow solutions to occur and to move us forward towards the results that we want. 
These ideas aren't necessarily things that I invented. I am attempting to synthesize, for your benefit, many ideas from national philosophy, psychology, marketing, and elsewhere into a set of ideals that I know will work if we can hold ourselves to them. I'm calling it ""Positive White Nationalism"" for lack of a better term at the moment. So what is PWN and what are the core ideas that make it work? Lets explore...:-Concentrate on Solutions, Not Problems 
It has been proven that people will subconsciously move toward what they concentrate on. If that happens to be what they don't want, then they will move in that direction whether they like it or not. I remember back when I was a teen, my driving instructor told us ""not to look at big trucks beside you on the highway; you'll steer right into them."" It's a nice metaphor for many things in life. Whatever you feed in your life with your attention, that is what your mind will go to work on. If we can steer ourselves towards the solutions, and not the problems, then that will at least get us pointed in the right direction. 
Speaking to many of you, I can tell that you are depressed. It seems that so many in our society are... and no wonder: so much of our society is grim. Hearing something bad or hearing about a problem creates a sensation of anger. Anger, when not acted upon, leads to feelings of frustration. This can be especially acute in men. Frustration, when built up enough, leads to feelings of futility, helplessness, and powerlessness, which is essentially ""depression"". To prevent this, you can either channel your feelings of anger into activity, or you can dial back the input of negative information. I'm proposing that people do both. By concentrating on the solutions, you focus your attention away from negative input, while at the same time encouraging you to act in a way that alleviates your anger in a constructive manner.-Reframe the Negative and Find the Positive 
On the surface this feels like such a juvenile thing. There is so much negative. We are truly facing the extinction of what most of us hold most dear. It feels overwhelming. Crushing. To ""pretend"" to be positive sounds ridiculous. I'm not talking about pretending. It may feel that way slightly at first. I'm talking about truly making the effort to find the positive in situations. It's always there. I can promise you that. Let me give you an example: say you read an article about a film and it's very anti-white. Instead of concentrating on that and talking about it, look for a film that isn't anti-white or even has pro-white messages. They do exist. The Invasion (2007) was packed full of underlying messages that support our views (which is why critics hated it!). 
I'm not condoning ignorance here, I'm saying that we can't get anywhere if we focus on the negative. Negative thoughts can be highly addictive. They will also destroy you and poison your life. Acknowledge the problems, but don't feed them. Push forward. 
The other benefit to this is that it makes our movement (and you as an individual) 1000 times more attractive to outsiders. You simply cannot attract people with a negative movement. Even in Germany, it wasn't the anti-Semitic rhetoric that got the German people on board, it was the hope, the positive message of unification and prosperity in the face of a destitute and broken future for the working class. We know that things are bad. Lets aim toward a future that works instead of wasting our energies on a past that we cannot change. I realize that at times it can be hard to enjoy your life because it seems like ""what's the point if it's all going out the window"". We all need to find ways to enjoy our lives though, and pull our thinking out of the venomous death spiral.-Lift your Own Race Up, Don't Push Others Down
If we want to spin our wheels trying to disparage other races while our own gets wiped off the map, then I say we deserve to die. It is futile and idiotic. We need to be helping out our own people, not doing petty sniping at others. Don't waste your energies on them. Let them do their own thing. They don't concern us. We concern us. Try doing real-world activities to help your white community. Be prepared to fight, but put your efforts into things that actually help in the present. Add value to your community, instead of take from it. Make money so you can support causes. Be an example of what is good so others can follow it. Find locals that are in need and organize a function to tackle that need. Celebrate what is good and amazing about our own culture instead of trying to point out what is bad about other cultures. That is attractive to people. That makes people want to experience and value the things that we value about our race. The only way we're going to create enough unity among our people to overcome the massive challenges ahead of us is to make them care about who they are. The only way we're going to do that is by showing and demonstrating all of the good qualities of our race. Bringing down someone else might make you feel good temporarily, but it makes you look bad and it undermines your message. Be the best that you can be in your life. You represent us!-Actions, Not Words
Whenever you can, force yourself to take an action, rather than make a rant or post something. It might sound weird, but say, upon hearing something that especially makes you sad and angry about race... maybe about a child getting hurt: instead of just wallowing in that, force yourself to do something. I don't mean seek out the guy that hurt the child and gun him down, I mean something constructive. 
Maybe your neighbor has a child that likes motorcycles. Invite your neighbor and his kid over and let the child help you fix yours while his dad and you drink a beer. I don't know. Something. Anything. Any positive action towards another white person is better than thoughts or futile posts against another non-white. 
Do it right away though. Don't give your anger time to settle inside you. Let it force you to act. We are designed to act! We are biological machines of action. Spend some time in the PLE posts and see that action speaks louder than words. You will feel so much better, your race will thank you, and the world will look upon us in a better light.
I realize that alot of this feels a little alien and perhaps cheesy. I myself, am a fighter by instinct, and alot of this goes against what I am ingrained to think, but in a sense, this IS fighting. It's fighting against the void that is threatening to swallow us up. 
Roll up your sleeves and take the 3 week PWN challenge: What is the 3 week PWN challenge you ask?... 
I challenge all stormfronters, including myself, to not post a single negative post for 3 weeks. Challenge yourself to find the positive. Challenge yourself to find a solution. Ask yourself, are you content to stew in a present where we are a doomed people, or are you willing to make the effort to at least try to move us in a different direction? You have nothing to lose. In the words of Jerry Maguire: ""Who's coming with me?""

An agency which jews openly declare is still, today, even in its ultra weakened state, enemy # 1. Two short, thrilling videos at this page help illustrate my point. Regards

Thank you for this! 
Living in a ****hole town where whites are a minority is really difficult to deal with sometimes. 
Walking into the local walmart and being the only family that is white or isnt ""mixed"" can be grating on our psyche. 
Being the only member of your family that didn't have mixed race kids, and being treated as if there is something wrong with like white women is annoying.
Trying to find like minded individuals and having to worry about whether or not they have a badge before you become friends can be frightening. 
But, in the end, I believe there is only one outcome to all of this division. Europeans have been the dominate force on earth for thousands of years, this era will just be a speed bump in history.

I am of the opinion that the average white man will start to think like us in the next few decades as he watches Mexicans invade the U.S. and the Muslims invade Europe. I think the future is brighter than what it seems now. It can only get so bad before the white man watches his children go hungry and decides to act.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


In the light of recent events, I would like to take this opportunity to reinforce the sentiments of this thread. Our greatest strength as a race has always been as organizers and builders. We are strong when we act together, and not as lone wolves. We are strong when we move towards our own success, and not against that of others.
It can seem an insurmountable task to achieve self determinism in a peaceful way, with the current political systems in the West completely dominated by the corrupt and powerful, but it isn't. Nothing is impossible for us. We need to hold it together and not destroy ourselves in a nova of emotions and violence. That is for the weak willed.
Do not be shamed. Be heard. Be even louder and more open now. Let people see that THIS is normal, not extreme. We will not be condemned. Lead a positive example. Do not go out with a bang.

What all white people must be is the best version they can be. Physically you must be strongest and fittest person you can be. Educate yourself, know your enemy, see through the media lies, and understand the narrative they want to spread, ""white guilt"".
Tattoos, why? It's whats inside, the belief. There is nothing more that they fear than the unknown.
We need specialist educated Marines, individual quality when achieved will lead to legions dedicated to the cause, because this is a cause, our cause.

Great advice +++
* Exercise (running/jogging and bodybuilding highly recommended -- keep the cardio and muscle work up)
* Eat healthy (don't buy processed ""foods"" and drinks. Less sugar and salt intake for heart and kidney reasons. Less alcohol for the stomach gut. Always support your local farmer market. Do not fund = support supermarket chains. Their produce is quantity not quality. They do not care about you. They care only about MONEY.)
* Stop smoking
Always dress well, shower and shave daily, carry yourself well and mind your own business i.e. do not stare.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Positive action. The thing I get from that is how much fun it could actually be. Consider, instead of mooning and crying about how terrible things are, what if each and every person picked one thing and did it? I'm not talking some grand demonstration. Simply picking something in your local area and doing it. Whether it is posting fliers, or putting up signs. Getting together with a couple like minded people and building your own community. Sitting around and engaging in long bouts of poor little me and self flagellation online is precisely what the enemy wants. The simplest action you can take can rebound with the most amazing consequences. Here is a simple idea. How many people remember the old small comic books we used to find in toilets and phone booths? The christian ones. Think if someone did the same thing but with our agenda. You walk around a mall dropping single leaflets. Take a day and hit several places. Sure a lot of them will wind up thrown in the trash. But that's not the point. If you reach one person, that might be the one person we need. Also, if you keep on doing it sooner or later some liberal or mud will go crying to the law and the media about all those evil Nazi leaflets someone is leaving around. What do you get from that? Free TV advertising. Be sneaky. Be smart. Nobody says that ticking off the muds and lefty libs can't be fun

If you say ""I am better"" then BE better.

If you claim superiority then prove it.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


A very good contribution. I thought after a few lines that I already knew how the author argues and that it would be unnecessary to continue reading, but fortunately I did it anyway.
I became a white nationalist because I was tired of crime, of nonwhites shamelessly receiving social benefits worked out by whites, of the gratuitousness of non-whites.
But it is dangerous to remain there. The bad news continues, and yet there is little we can do to change that. Everyone should know the crime stats, because these are the reality we have to live with, but to focus only on them is not good for the psyche.
We have to be realistic, and do what really helps our race.
Every newborn child is a victory. Every white marriage is a victory. The establishment of friendly relations between whites is a victory. Living up to our values is a victory.
We have to show that traditions are a better way of life than big-city-degeneration, not online through discussions, but offline by *doing so*.
Don't be pulled down by bad news - keep a rough picture of what is happening around you, but don't let negative emotions eat you up.
A great example of Positive White Nationalism is the content of the following link:/pol/ - Break-off groups are the solution for low white fertility and racemixing - Politically Incorrect - 4chan
It contains everything that should be significant for us:
-It requires interaction with the real world
-It promotes a long-term strategy
-It doesn't waste useless energy devaluing someone, it ignores them
-It promotes the building of white families and communities
-It promotes independence from authorities that are not interested in our prosperity anyway
Positive White Nationalism is probably not the original reason for most people to join us - at least not for me - and you go through different phases, but in the end you should arrive here. It has taken me almost two years, but I hope I can say that I have finally reached the end of the fog and can now look clearly ahead.

Negroid [...]




Negroid works better and its clean. Negroids are Satanic and they need to be punished for it but the retribution that needs to be dealt may have to come slowly. They have completely lost control of themselves and because they have become so brutish the only way to deal with them may be with extreme force. However, just small everyday small changes in the way we deal with Negroids will help deal with them in a way that doesn't shock our society into chaos. This may change the way we think about them.

Europa- A nation with no boundaries
Europan- A citizen of that nation (Pan Europa)
Using common terminology is important, these are my suggestions.

I was just about to post something along the line you have just addressed. Not as elaborate but to this point-what do we do now?- With the viciousness of BLM/Anitfa travelling all over the country, well except for the Dakotas and Montana and a few other states. My statement is meant more for those who either live in minority(black especially) areas and although the criminal rioters may have not reached them at this point it is likely they soon will. For those living in Portland, OR. Kenosha, WS the SHTF now. This is a state of emergency for them that are poorer class whites. Action has to be taken now to get ready for worse times and believe me if Trump wins we will have more desperate rioting, killing beating and probably kidnapping. If Biden wins the left will have to face the violent uprising from the White people who are vulnerable, since they will be the first targeted for slavery. After that is accomplished the Biden gang will go onto the white rural crowd if he is still deemed fit for office, if not then the true vicious revolutionary Marxist will take his place- Kamala Harris and all of America will then have to become a battleground. I think that we have to make plans yesterday to insure the 14 words. Sorry I cannot bring my self to a positive focus.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


In my eyes the whole racially aware white movement around the world (including Europe) must think about building up ""White settlement enclaves"" for our people. This is the only way the save our race from extinction. Without enough whites the current industrial civilization will collapse in Europe and North America in the next decades - like the old high cultures in the past. This development is certain if you understand the connection between race and civilization. So ""settlement enclaves"" are our last chance. This is also the ""progressive way"" for our movement instead of constant complaining about the crumbling of our former white world.

The European neandrathal is apparent in all genes, however whites are not negro, Asian, middle eastern, or Hispanic, none of those genes exist in eurowhite people..
The genome was discovered to have an isolated sequence for the white race, making us distinct from all other beings.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Above and beyond ""positive White nationalism"", I would rather call for ""pragmatic White Nationalism"", as positive has too many Self Help guru connotations in my book, and can appear delusional (though I fully approve much of what is said in the OP).
It really doesn't need a wall of text to express what I believe.
I believe that we should do whatever it takes to get to power in our lifetime.
What I witness is that too often, White Nationalist fall into the trap of inaction and ideological masturbation, that is, endlessly arguing useless intellectual debates whilst life and reality is passing in front of their noses.
The only relevant White Nationalist policy is the one that actually happens right now, in the form of a legitimate political movement. Anything else is a waste of time and can be safely binned for the foreseeable future. It doesn't exist. 
White Nationalism is not about being an obscure online group of people. Real White Nationalism is being on the ground with our communities, fighting for ideals we believe in. Whether it's organising a local militia that prevents coloured crime and protects our children, or getting involved at the political level.

Jews are not White,
The Jewish faith is at it’s core to promote Jews above all others. That is what they believe. There are your Supremacists. And their belief drives them. They own many things in our nation for example, and those entities all work together against us to promote their agenda.

As far as possibly being part Indian, that most likely is a fallacy.
There has been for a while, many touting Indian heritage when there was none. I don’t know why, but many families and their stories. Perhaps to feel special in some way.

I can have a French man's baby and give it my German husband's name on the birth certificate. 
Someone could be adopted a few generations back and are given the new family name yet they do not have that blood at all. Orphans do not always have records.

If it wasn't for the numbers, whites easily outdo all others. Because of the numbers though, you do have to watch what the others do and make sure they aren't taking advantage of us. As much as we might not put others down or be hateful, they do not do the same. It is important to keep out the wolves from out flocks.

Thoughts....
I've been saying this for a while we all need to unite so lets stop the hierarchy nonsense and UNITE. So i agree why focus on what other races are doing and focus on what we are doing. Are we being the best version of ourselves, are we being led up a garden path to poorly portray ourselves and why are we self destructing by the manipulation of others, We ARE the founders of civilisation why are we acting so crappy to one another and why the self hate.

That is attractive to people. That makes people want to experience and value the things that we value about our race. The only way we're going to create enough unity among our people to overcome the massive challenges ahead of us is to make them care about who they are. The only way we're going to do that is by showing and demonstrating all of the good qualities of our race. Bringing down someone else might make you feel good temporarily, but it makes you look bad and it undermines your message. Be the best that you can be in your life. You represent us!-Actions, Not Words
Whenever you can, force yourself to take an action, rather than make a rant or post something. It might sound weird, but say, upon hearing something that especially makes you sad and angry about race... maybe about a child getting hurt: instead of just wallowing in that, force yourself to do something. I don't mean seek out the guy that hurt the child and gun him down, I mean something constructive. 
Maybe your neighbor has a child that likes motorcycles. Invite your neighbor and his kid over and let the child help you fix yours while his dad and you drink a beer. I don't know. Something. Anything. Any positive action towards another white person is better than thoughts or futile posts against another non-white. 
Do it right away though. Don't give your anger time to settle inside you. Let it force you to act. We are designed to act! We are biological machines of action. Spend some time in the PLE posts and see that action speaks louder than words. You will feel so much better, your race will thank you, and the world will look upon us in a better light.
I realize that alot of this feels a little alien and perhaps cheesy. I myself, am a fighter by instinct, and alot of this goes against what I am ingrained to think, but in a sense, this IS fighting. It's fighting against the void that is threatening to swallow us up. 
Roll up your sleeves and take the 3 week PWN challenge: What is the 3 week PWN challenge you ask?... 
I challenge all stormfronters, including myself, to not post a single negative post for 3 weeks. Challenge yourself to find the positive. Challenge yourself to find a solution. Ask yourself, are you content to stew in a present where we are a doomed people, or are you willing to make the effort to at least try to move us in a different direction? You have nothing to lose. In the words of Jerry Maguire: ""Who's coming with me?""

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


In a White Nationalist Society would it be acceptable for Children over the age of fourteen to begin working if they have no intentions of advanced studies? Should children be working agricultural jobs? Slaughtering poultry and things of that sort? Tending to the needs of a sustainable community, even if international trade and some capitalism is still prevalent?

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


I can't believe it. I hope that more people are aware of history because there is a long list of things that people have done to people of color. There are reasons to why people do not like the actions made by white people. It is time to accept that ancestors did this and do better today because there are no positives to take away from a world that is not accepting of the changes from other people. It is hard that this happened because there are a lot of negative activity that has happened through the years. I do respect your points but It might be rough for other people.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


Those are some really wise words friend, ever since I got in this movement I have felt this inner struggle, an anger so deep towards other races and I couldn't do anything about it, no white companions to share thoughts as every white person I've ever met kept on ranting about how oppressed some random [...] or a dirty jew is in a country where blacks have taken over, Brazil which once was a glorious prospering nation is now becoming a black hellhole, kind of like how Rhodesia became lawless after it became Zimbabwe.
I really want to follow your tips man, I am a very positive guy by nature but every time I try to find a positive something happens that instantly makes it a negative, white nationalists in my nation are all but destroyed, our economy is corrupt to a level where I can barely survive, let alone leave this place.
I really hope god will save us all, and that Brazil can return to being white and prosper again. America is going down the same hole we did long ago.
I will however try to complete your challenge, it's good to have some positive things for a change

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


These are great words to live by. I made a Nazi friend on gab that red pilled me. I was already frustrated and had enough of all the anti-white rhetoric. Problem was, I had some simple basic question like what about Christian bible saying jews are Gods chosen people. Every time I would ask a WN about this they would get defensive and go on some anti-jew rant instead of actually answering my question. All that did was make me feel like WN blame everything bad on the jew just like everyone else is blaming it on the whites. I saw no difference between them and really put me off. Years later I met this friend. Instead of chastising me, he actually provided me with videos and reading materials that explained all of it. Thanks to him, I now know the bible doesn't say that and our beliefs have actually been hijacked by the jews. He really put a positive light on things. That made all of the difference.

Please don't use the term ""Nazi"". Despite some claims to the contrary by some who might claim to be White Nationalists, Racialists, Fascists, or Third Positionists (some no doubt sincere), it is a derogatory label and is almost entirely used by our enemies and opposition as a pejorative term. Most of those who're genuinely pro-White who use it do so out of ignorance, lack of understanding, and/or because they claim to be anti-NS (again, usually due to a lack of understanding and/or a complete misunderstanding and ignorance).
National Socialist or NS for short. When talking about Germany of the period it would be NS Germany or the Third Reich, not ""Nazi Germany"".
Thank you.

Thank you for reading.



If it wasn't for the numbers, whites easily outdo all others. Because of the numbers though, you do have to watch what the others do and make sure they aren't taking advantage of us. As much as we might not put others down or be hateful, they do not do the same. It is important to keep out the wolves from out flocks.

Re: The way forward: Positive White Nationalism


FANTASTIC post, very articulate and well thought out i could argue on one or two minor details but seriously proud of you m8. This is exactly what I would expect from a white man. Passion and Pride....WOW 
Thoughts....
I've been saying this for a while we all need to unite so lets stop the hierarchy nonsense and UNITE. So i agree why focus on what other races are doing and focus on what we are doing. Are we being the best version of ourselves, are we being led up a garden path to poorly portray ourselves and why are we self destructing by the manipulation of others, We ARE the founders of civilisation why are we acting so crappy to one another and why the self hate.

The goal of this post is to create a cohesive strategy for awakening our people and eventually generating a modern European cultural renaissance. It is less of a nuts-and-bolts solution, and is more of an over-arching philosophy and lifestyle, an ethos for white nationalists to follow which will allow solutions to occur and to move us forward towards the results that we want. 
These ideas aren't necessarily things that I invented. I am attempting to synthesize, for your benefit, many ideas from national philosophy, psychology, marketing, and elsewhere into a set of ideals that I know will work if we can hold ourselves to them. I'm calling it ""Positive White Nationalism"" for lack of a better term at the moment. So what is PWN and what are the core ideas that make it work? Lets explore...:-Concentrate on Solutions, Not Problems 
It has been proven that people will subconsciously move toward what they concentrate on. If that happens to be what they don't want, then they will move in that direction whether they like it or not. I remember back when I was a teen, my driving instructor told us ""not to look at big trucks beside you on the highway; you'll steer right into them."" It's a nice metaphor for many things in life. Whatever you feed in your life with your attention, that is what your mind will go to work on. If we can steer ourselves towards the solutions, and not the problems, then that will at least get us pointed in the right direction. 
Speaking to many of you, I can tell that you are depressed. It seems that so many in our society are... and no wonder: so much of our society is grim. Hearing something bad or hearing about a problem creates a sensation of anger. Anger, when not acted upon, leads to feelings of frustration. This can be especially acute in men. Frustration, when built up enough, leads to feelings of futility, helplessness, and powerlessness, which is essentially ""depression"". To prevent this, you can either channel your feelings of anger into activity, or you can dial back the input of negative information. I'm proposing that people do both. By concentrating on the solutions, you focus your attention away from negative input, while at the same time encouraging you to act in a way that alleviates your anger in a constructive manner.-Reframe the Negative and Find the Positive 
On the surface this feels like such a juvenile thing. There is so much negative. We are truly facing the extinction of what most of us hold most dear. It feels overwhelming. Crushing. To ""pretend"" to be positive sounds ridiculous. I'm not talking about pretending. It may feel that way slightly at first. I'm talking about truly making the effort to find the positive in situations. It's always there. I can promise you that. Let me give you an example: say you read an article about a film and it's very anti-white. Instead of concentrating on that and talking about it, look for a film that isn't anti-white or even has pro-white messages. They do exist. The Invasion (2007) was packed full of underlying messages that support our views (which is why critics hated it!). 
I'm not condoning ignorance here, I'm saying that we can't get anywhere if we focus on the negative. Negative thoughts can be highly addictive. They will also destroy you and poison your life. Acknowledge the problems, but don't feed them. Push forward. 
The other benefit to this is that it makes our movement (and you as an individual) 1000 times more attractive to outsiders. You simply cannot attract people with a negative movement. Even in Germany, it wasn't the anti-Semitic rhetoric that got the German people on board, it was the hope, the positive message of unification and prosperity in the face of a destitute and broken future for the working class. We know that things are bad. Lets aim toward a future that works instead of wasting our energies on a past that we cannot change. I realize that at times it can be hard to enjoy your life because it seems like ""what's the point if it's all going out the window"". We all need to find ways to enjoy our lives though, and pull our thinking out of the venomous death spiral.-Lift your Own Race Up, Don't Push Others Down
If we want to spin our wheels trying to disparage other races while our own gets wiped off the map, then I say we deserve to die. It is futile and idiotic. We need to be helping out our own people, not doing petty sniping at others. Don't waste your energies on them. Let them do their own thing. They don't concern us. We concern us. Try doing real-world activities to help your white community. Be prepared to fight, but put your efforts into things that actually help in the present. Add value to your community, instead of take from it. Make money so you can support causes. Be an example of what is good so others can follow it. Find locals that are in need and organize a function to tackle that need. Celebrate what is good and amazing about our own culture instead of trying to point out what is bad about other cultures. That is attractive to people. That makes people want to experience and value the things that we value about our race.
